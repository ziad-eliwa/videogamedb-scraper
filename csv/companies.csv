Valve Corporation,"Valve Corporation is an entertainment software company founded in 1996 by Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington in Kirkland, Washington. They were both previously with Microsoft. Valve's debut product, Half-Life, released in November 1998, has won more than 50 Game of the Year honors worldwide. On 12 September 2003, the company launched the digital distribution platform Steam. Steam's launch and the question of licenses for cyber cafes resulted in a dispute with Valve's publisher at the time, Vivendi Universal (as owner of Sierra), which was resolved in April 2005 in Valve's favor, with all their future titles being self-published from that moment on. Steam would gradually gain traction as the most popular digital distribution service for PC games by the late 2000s, for both Valve's and third-party titles. All of the company's titles from 1998 to mid-2004 ran on the in-house GoldSrc engine until it was succeeded by the Source engine with the release of Counter-Strike: Source in 2004. Valve then used the Source engine for all of their titles until the engine was succeeded by Source 2 in 2015. Their franchises include the Half-Life / Portal universe, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead and DotA (except the original). Aside games and engines, Valve has developed a Linux distribution named SteamOS (as of 2013), Steam Machine and Steam Controller hardware (2015-2019), virtual reality set family Valve Index (as of 2019), and the Steam Deck handheld device (as of 2022). From January 2008 to June 2009, Valve owned the studio Turtle Rock Studios (then renamed to Valve South) to develop Left 4 Dead, after which the studio was closed, then re-established independently from Valve in February 2010. In November 2012, Valve acquired Star Filled Studios. In January 2017, Valve acquired Impulsonic. In April 2018, Valve acquired Campo Santo Productions.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/c1b8619a-bc83-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1998,2029,United States

"Epic Games, Inc.","Epic Games is a company started as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991 by Tim Sweeney in Rockville, Maryland (US). The same year the name was changed to Epic MegaGames, Inc. and the company became a world leader in developing and publishing shareware games. Epic's best-known creations include Epic Pinball, Jazz Jackrabbit, One Must Fall 2097 and Jill of the Jungle.  The biggest change for the company came in 1998 when the first-person shooter Unreal was released. It was the start of the Unreal series of shooters that ran until 2017. At the same time, the company started licensing the engine powering the games, various iterations of the Unreal Engine, used in a large range of titles. It put the company on the map next to id Software, Inc. as one of the most prominent engine development studios. In 1999, the studio received its current name, Epic Games, Inc. In September 2006, the establishment of Epic Games China, Ltd. was announced. Based in Shanghai, it was set up to provide low-cost game asset outsourcing to both Epic and third parties. The studio currently goes by the name Yingpei Games. In June 2012, the China-based Tencent Holdings Limited announced to have acquired a minority stake of 10% in the company. In September 2012 the establishment of a new Epic studio in Seattle was announced to work on the fourth version of the Unreal Engine. Also in June 2012, the studio formed Epic Baltimore, later renamed Impossible Studios. The division was closed in February 2013. The company released Fortnite in July 2017. After it became a cultural phenomenon, development of other games such as the Unreal Tournament reboot was abandoned, with all teams working on Fortnite, Unreal Engine or other services for external companies. On 6 December 2018, the company released the Epic Games Store as a competitor to other PC game storefronts.

"Electronic Arts, Inc.","Founded in 1982 as Amazin' Software by Trip Hawkins, Electronic Arts (EA) has built an empire of brand labels. The company is considered one of the largest players in the industry, often through acquisitions of successful development studios. It owns a large number of well-known intellectual properties such as Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Sims/SimCity, Command & Conquer, Battlefield and a wide range of sports licenses and rights to use external properties for films and toys. Electronic Arts Distribution (EAD) was EA's third party publishing house, which distributed titles from the likes of Disney Interactive, LEGO, LucasArts, Square Soft, and more throughout Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific (Australia). EAD was in existence from 1987-1991 and lead by Larry Probst, Senior VP at the time. Distribution of third-party titles continued with the division EA Distribution, until September 1997 when it was reformed to include full publishing, with development and marketing as well. In June 2003 the initiative was renamed EA Partners. In 2016, the initiative was revived with the EA Originals label. EA Studios was EA's development arm, which consists of studios dotted around the United States, with the more common studios in use in Seattle and Canada. EA also has development studios in Japan and London. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the company would acquire a large amount of studios and intellectual properties, such as Origin Systems, Maxis Software, Bullfrog Productions, Westwood Studios, Digital Illusions CE and others, while also founding its own like EA Redwood Shores (later Visceral Games) (see full list below). A common criticism towards EA would be the rate in which it would close or reshuffle its subsidiaries. The company had a disappointing fiscal year in 2007. They miscalculated the success of the Nintendo Wii and focused mainly on the Xbox 360 and the PS3, resulting in only two Wii launch titles, ports of existing games: Need for Speed: Carbon and Madden NFL 07. To catch up, they acquired Headgate Studios which they had been working together with for the Tiger Woods PGA series since 2000, and turned it into EA Salt Lake, focusing the studio entirely on Wii development. On 11 October 2007, EA acquired VG Holding Corp., the holding company of BioWare and Pandemic Studios for US$ 775 million.  In June 2007, the company was reorganized into four labels:  EA Casual (led by Kathy Vrabeck) EA Games (led by Frank Gibeau) EA Sports (led by Joel Linzner) The Sims (led by Nancy Smith until October 2008, then Rod Humble)  The four labels are supported by two new groups: Central Development Services and Global Publishing. Central Development Services, both led by Executive Vice President John Schappert. The Casual label was closed in November 2008 and merged into The Sims label along with the Hasbro partnership. The Sims as a label also disappeared. In February 2008, the company also set its sights on major publisher Take-Two Interactive Software and most importantly the Rockstar studios it owns, mostly in response of the merger between Activision and Vivendi, but eventually in October 2008 it was confirmed there was no agreement. In November 2009, EA announced to axe 1,500 jobs by the end of March 2010 as part of a new cost reduction plan, following net losses that increased during its second quarter to USD 391 million. Several studios were closed (such as Pandemic Studios) or restructured (such as EA Los Angeles being split to Danger Close and Victory Games). In June 2011, EA decided to stop distributing their PC games via Steam, as they focused on their new competing service Origin, which replaced their prior EA Download Manager (EADM). Some existing titles like Crysis 2 were even delisted from Steam. On 12 July 2011, EA acquired PopCap Games. In June 2012, COO Peter Moore announced a shift toward free-to-play and microtransactions in the gaming industry as a whole, and the company itself would match this business model around this time, to much controversy. On 18 March 2013, John Riccitiello would step down as EA's CEO. After a transitional period during which the position was temporarily held by Larry Probst, Andrew Wilson was named as the company's CEO on 17 September 2013, after years of leading the EA Sports label. In the same year, EA fired approximately 10% of its workforce, but also acquired an exclusive Star Wars license for games for 10 years. In mid-2014, online services for many EA games were to be shut down as part of the GameSpy Industries closure, but despite securing an extra month of uptime compared to other companies' titles (i.e. 30 June 2014 as the end date), EA would not migrate any of them to a different infrastructure. In 2015, EA would open itself to publishing smaller productions by companies they do not directly own, such as Unravel. Their 2017 title Star Wars: Battlefront II would come at the peak of public attention over the loot box monetization system, which many companies were using at the time. EA was perceived as the clearest example of such practices, and faced legal issues in multiple countries over it. In the same year, they acquired Respawn Entertainment. In October 2019, EA would return to publishing their PC games on Steam, but largely with an additional EA account requirement and/or Origin integration. In 2020, they would rebrand their EA Access subscription system to EA Play, and would offer it on non-Origin storefronts such as Steam and Microsoft Store's Windows Apps section in addition to the Xbox and PlayStation stores it was available on previously. In the same year, they outbid Take-Two Interactive Software to acquire Codemasters. In 2023, the company split its operations to two labels - EA Sports and EA Entertainment, with studios meant to be assigned to one of them. On 29 September 2025, it was announced that EA entered an agreement to be acquired by a consortium which includes investment firms PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for approximately US$ 55 million. Andrew Wilson would remain as CEO. Known subsidiaries Names in italics used to be subsidiaries, but no longer are as they were closed or sold off.

SEGA Corporation,"SEGA Corporation is a multinational video game software developer and an arcade software and hardware development company headquartered in Ōta, Tokyo, Japan. Sega previously developed and manufactured its own brand of home video game consoles from 1983 to 2001, but a restructure was announced on 31 January 2001 that ceased continued production of its existing home console, effectively exiting the company from the home console business. While arcade development would continue unchanged for a long while, the restructure shifted the focus of the company's home video game software development to consoles developed by various third-party manufacturers. They would sell their arcade business to Genda Inc. (under the GiGo brand) in January 2022. SEGA has developed and produced many popular video games in a variety of genres, including renowned series such as Crazy Taxi, The House of the Dead, Jet Grind/Set Radio, Phantasy Star, Sakura Wars, Sonic the Hedgehog, Virtua Fighter, Wonder Boy, Yakuza and many others. Through acquisition of other companies, it has also held numerous successful intellectual properties like Company of Heroes, Endless, Football Manager, Total War, Two Point and others.  History Sega's roots can be traced back to a small company based in Honolulu, Hawaii named Standard Games, that began operations in 1940. In 1951, Raymond Lemaire and Richard Stewart moved the company to Tokyo, to develop and distribute coin-operated amusement-type games such as jukeboxes and slot machines, and renamed it Service Games. Within a few years Service Games began importing these machines to American military bases throughout Japan. In 1954, David Rosen, an American officer in the Air Force, launched a two-minute photo booth business in Tokyo. This company eventually became Rosen Enterprises, and in 1957 began importing coin-operated games to Japan. By 1965, Rosen Enterprises grew to a chain of over 200 arcades, with Service Games its only competitor. Rosen then orchestrated a merger between Rosen Enterprises and Service Games, who by then had their own factory facilities, becoming chief executive of the new company, Sega Enterprises, which derived its name from the first two letters of SErvice GAmes. Within a year, Sega began the transition from importer to manufacturer, with the release of the Rosen designed submarine simulator game Periscope. It was soon exported to both Europe and the United States, becoming the world's first 25 cent arcade game. In 1982, Sega introduced one of the industry's first three-dimensional games, SubRoc 3-D. The following year, an overabundance of arcade games led to the video game crash; Sega then pioneered the use of laser disks in the video game Astronbelt, designing and releasing its first home video game console, the SG-1000.  In 1986, Sega of America was poised to take advantage of the resurgent video game market in the United States. Sega released the Sega Master System console and the first Alex Kidd game, who became the company's unofficial mascot until 1991, when Sonic the Hedgehog took over. After this Sega went on to create 3 more home consoles: the Genesis/Mega Drive (1988/89), Saturn (1994/95) and their final home console the Dreamcast (1998/99).

Microsoft Corporation,"Founded in 1975, Microsoft has become the biggest name in productivity, home entertainment and business software - from the most used operating systems in the world (DOS and later Windows) to Microsoft Office, Visual Studio, Azure and more. Microsoft has also become a major contributor to video games software in the PC market since the mid 90's, with publishing rights to BattleTech, Age of Empires, Gears of War and Flight Simulator, among many others. Since 2000, the company has used the Microsoft Game Studios (today Xbox Game Studios) label for the video games it publishes. On 13 October 2023, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard after over a year of seeking approval from international institutions, but instead of merging it under the existing Xbox Game Studios label, it was placed alongside that label as part of the new Microsoft Gaming division. Microsoft entered the home video games console market in 2001 with the Xbox. It was followed by the Xbox 360 in 2005, Xbox One in 2013 and Xbox Series X|S in 2020.

"Capcom Co., Ltd.","Capcom Co., Ltd. is an Osaka-based Japanese developer and publisher of video games, known for creating popular franchises such as Mega Man, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, Ace Attorney, Dragon's Dogma, and others. Originally established in 1983, it has since become an international enterprise with branches and subsidiaries in North America, Europe, and East Asia. The original companies that spawned Capcom's Japanese branch were I.R.M Corporation founded on 30 May 1979, as well as its subsidiary Japan Capsule Computer Co., Ltd., both of which were devoted to the manufacturing and distribution of electronic game machines. The two companies underwent a name change to Sambi Co., Ltd. in September 1981, while Capcom Co., Ltd. itself was first established on 11 June 1983, for the purpose of taking over the internal sales department. In January 1989, the old affiliate company Capcom Co., Ltd. merged with Sambi Co., Ltd., resulting in the current Japanese branch. The name Capcom is an abbreviation of ""Capsule Computer"", a term coined by the company to describe the arcade machines it solely manufactured in its early years, designed to set themselves apart from personal computers that were becoming widespread at that time. The word capsule alludes to how Capcom likened its game software to ""a capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun"", as well as to the company's desire to protect its intellectual property with a hard outer shell, preventing illegal copies and inferior imitations. While Capcom's first product was the coin-operated Little League from July 1983, its first real video game, the arcade title Vulgus, was released in May 1984.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/b49ed742-071e-11ee-b9fa-02420a00013d.webp,1984,2025,Japan
"Activision Publishing, Inc.","Activision is an American video game publishing company. It was founded in 1979 by four programmers at Atari after they wanted more money and recognition for the games that they created for the Atari 2600. A sales sheet, intended to list what type of games sold best so the programmers would make more like those, showed that the four of them made over 60% of the company's sales at the time, over US$ 60 million. Atari president Ray Kassar dismissed their contract renegotiations and at that point they left. David Crane, Alan Miller, Robert Whitehead, Larry Kaplan, and former record industry executive Jim Levy founded Activision and their games would have a biography and their signature at the end of the instruction booklets. This took off and Activision made millions in sales. It also marked the start of third-party publishing and development, as previously the owner of the hardware also made all the games for it. The name of the company was chosen because they wanted a name that was higher up alphabetically than Atari in order to show that it was superior. In 1984, sales began to fall as the video game crash happened (in late 1983), there was a split on the direction of the company on whether to keep going with video games or computer games. Over the next few year, key employees at Activision left and formed their own companies. Many of these new companies chose names alphabetically above Activision (such as Accolade, Acclaim, and Absolute Entertainment). With sales dropping and Jim Levy's style of crediting individuals in the games becoming less effective, he left the company in 1985. In 1989, they started focusing on other computer software and changed their name to Mediagenic. In 1991, Mediagenic filed for bankruptcy, eventually they changed their name back to Activision and in 1993, they surfaced again. Since then, Activision has been turned into the second largest publishing company in the United States. In the late 1990s and much of the 2000s, the company acted as the main distributor for LucasArts' games. It additionally operated the Activision Value Publishing subsidiary for budget-range games. In 2000, Activision reorganized into a holding company organizational structure. The reorganization was made effective by a merger between Activision, Inc. (the surviving company) and ATVI Merger Sub, Inc. a subsidiary of Activision Holding Company, Inc., which in return was a subsidiary of Activision, Inc.  The merger resulted in all shares of Activision Holding Company, Inc. owned by Activision, Inc. to be canceled and retired, followed by Activision, Inc. changing its name to Activision Publishing Inc. and Activision Holding Company, Inc. to Activision, Inc. The newly Activision Publishing Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision, Inc. In the same year, Activision stopped developing games in their internal Los Angeles studio - the last productions Star Trek: Armada and Call to Power II were finished with the help of Mad Doc Software. From then on, development was handled by owned subsidiaries and licensed external parties. In 2008, the company was acquired for US$ 18.8 billion by Vivendi, a media conglomerate. The new holding company was named Activision Blizzard, Inc.. Activision would gain the bulk of the IPs of the Sierra backlog, but would sell some franchises and studios off immediately.

Nintendo of America Inc.,"This subsidiary of Nintendo Co., Ltd. is based in Redmond, Washington. It began its operations in 1980 and was initially headed by Hiroshi Yamuachi's son-in-law, Minoru Arakawa. Since then they have exclusively published and localized games. After the video game crash in 1983, Arakawa decided to take advantage of this by bringing the Famicom to America. He feared that cheap games from Taiwan might flood the market and he got Nintendo's engineers to create a lockout chip, therefore Nintendo would only manufacture the cartridges for the console (unlike in Japan, where Nintendo, Konami, Namco, Bandai, Capcom and Jaleco made their own cartridges, custom chips, etc;). This also pushed for Nintendo to license all games in North America. Arakawa also feared that companies would also produce a bunch of low quality games, thus created the rule where a publisher can only publish five games per year. This rule was dropped after 1991, as companies such as Konami would own a second publishing label (i.e. Konami's Ultra Games/Palcom software). Nintendo of America has always had a strong censoring policy on games. The company has also been a strong supporter of Rare, Ltd during the time that Nintendo owned the company. It also has had a key role in publishing and localizing some games that were popular in other areas of the world and would bring them to North America for North American audiences.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/26131f26-bc7b-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1980,2025,United States
"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","Nintendo (任天堂), founded originally by Fusajiro Yamauchi in Kyoto, Japan as Nintendo Koppai, has been around since 1889. The company originally sold high-quality Japanese playing cards (hanafuda) and later dabbled in toys and early electronic games. In the 1980's, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi wanted to change its direction. After seeking advice from his toy designers, they decided to turn towards developing arcade games. After the success of Donkey Kong in 1981, they decided to stay in the market. After its continuing success, they wanted to develop their own console, one that looked nice, and one that could be bought by the Japanese consumer for $99 US. This eventually went to $199, but it still sold very well. Nintendo went on to splitting its research and development into 4 distinct divisions, each of them were responsible for certain aspects of Nintendo's console.

Square Enix Limited,"Domark In 1983 Dominic Wheatley and Mark Strachan were Junior Account Executives for a small advertising agency in Great Britain. While looking for new business for the agency, they realized that home software was poorly marketed. Dominic came up with the idea to start a company after showing Mark the C64 game The Heroes of Karn which he had bought for his son. The two entrepreneurs had no programming experience and so they approached their business plan from the marketing side. Within a few months they both quit their jobs at the agency, secured 20+ shareholders, and in 1984 Domark Limited, London UK, was born. Eureka! was their first game, written by Ian Livingstone, one of the company's earliest investors. They hired Hungarian company Andromeda to program it, and established Concept Marketing as a separate company to handle a large promotional campaign for the game, offering a £25,000 prize to the first person to completely solve the game. Through their extensive marketing efforts on this game, Domark was off to a great start. During the following years, Domark secured licenses for several well-known IPs including Trivia Pursuit, James Bond, and Star Wars, again using outside companies to do the programming for them. The company concentrated on publishing and marketing at first, but, eventually, in-house artists, designers, programmers, and technicians were hired to make Domark a totally self-sufficient company. The company had a Macintosh programming team called ""The Domain"" and another development team was ""The Kremlin"". This surge of growth caused moves to new locations in London several times. 1990, Domark Limited became Domark Group Ltd. and was the main corporate entity for the entire Domark conglomerate of companies including Domark Software Ltd. (UK, founded 1990) and Domark Software Inc. (USA, founded late 1992 or early 1993). This company was the owner of all copyrights, licenses, and trademarks acquired and created by Domark collectively. This name is most commonly credited with ""Software, Instructions, Artwork and Packaging"" on game boxes and in credits. It is believed that production of marketing materials, promotions, artwork and printing was handled by this company, leaving the creation, publishing and distribution of the actual products to the lower divisions.  Eidos After Domark Group Limited, Simis Ltd., and The Big Red Software Company Ltd. were bought by Eidos Public Limited Company (which became the holding company), all three were merged into Domark to create Eidos Interactive Limited. This was followed by the acquisition of 8-bit publishing powerhouse U.S. Gold, which brought the development studio Core Design with it. Following the unexpected success of Core's Tomb Raider (1996), Eidos found itself catapulted to the center of massive attention and profits. A string of franchises were born, including Commandos, Hitman, Deus Ex, Legacy of Kain and Thief.  Square Enix At the end of March 2009, Eidos as a whole was acquired by Square Enix, who now owns it. Since then this company handles the European publishing and distribution. Not to be confused with Square Enix (2009) Limited, the former European publishing arm of Enix / Square Enix which only remains for tax purposes.

Paradox Interactive AB,"Founded in the early-to-mid 1980s, Target Games AB was a gaming company located in Stockholm, Sweden. Until the mid 1990s, the company developed roleplaying board games and published them under the brand name Äventyrsspel (meaning ""adventure games""). The most well-known of their board games were: Warzone (cyberpunk war game, 1995), Kult (contemporary fantasy horror game, 1991) and Chronopia (dark fantasy war game). The company also produced a line of resin miniatures and terrain items to accompany their tabletop games. They divided their line of products into 3 major areas:    Adventure: miniature and roleplaying board games   Interactive: all entertainment software   Prins August: all family games and toy candy  Video games released by Target Games included Svea Rike (1997) and its sequel Svea Rike 2 (1999). Target Games' known divisions were:  Target Games AB Target Games Interactive AB (Video Games Division) Target Games Adventure AB (board game accessories) with the subdivisions Target Games UK Target Games US Target Games Eire    In late 1999, Target Games went into bankruptcy proceedings, sold off its interactive division (computer games) to form Paradox Entertainment AB, then sold its adventure gaming division (miniatures) to Paradox. The Target company principals kept ownership of the intellectual property, licensing some to Paradox.  In January 2000, all of the company stock of Paradox Entertainment AB was sold in a major buy-out by external investors and former management members Fredrik Malmberg and Nils Gulliksson, who became its Chief Executive Officer. All of the Target Games divisions and branches were closed or acquired, and Paradox Entertainment AB became the new company name. Paradox Entertainment AB developed and published games for four years between 2000 and 2004. Released titles included:  Svea Rike III (2000) Europa Universalis (2000) Europa Universalis II (2001) Hearts of Iron (2002) Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun (2003) Crusader Kings (2004)  In November 2001, Paradox Entertainment formed Point Blank Development, an independent company to handle game development based on the acclaimed Valpurgius 3D technology and new gameplay innovations. Paradox Entertainment was the major stockholder of this new company. In November 2004, the entire interactive branch was sold to Theodore Bergquist, the current CEO of the company. Bergquist named his new company Paradox Interactive AB. The deal included all of the previous video games and everything currently in production. Paradox Entertainment AB, still lead by CEO Fredrik Malmberg, left the gaming industry entirely and diverted its interests to developing and licensing character-based properties including Conan, stories by pulp author Robert E. Howard and others. Through its subsidiary in Los Angeles, California, (Paradox Entertainment Inc.), it was developing several major motion pictures. In May 2015, it was acquired by Malmberg's company Cabinet Entertainment. While Cabinet continued to hold the IP business, Paradox Entertainment was renamed to Sensori AB and sold medical supplies. The first game to be released under the Paradox Interactive AB banner was Hearts of Iron II. Many other titles have been developed and produced by the company, many of which were sequels to older Paradox Entertainment games and were still supported by the new company. Paradox Interactive AB's headquarters remain in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2006 the company announced to refocus their efforts into publishing rather than developing games. An additional office was opened in New York City and, in April 2006, their GamersGate AB distribution portal was launched. Once that really started to grow, the company was split once again. Since January 2012, Paradox Interactive is the game publisher and Paradox Development Studio that focus on game development. In 2022, the company launched the Paradox Arc label for externally developed games.

Taito Corporation,"Taito was originally established in 1953 by Russian-Jewish businessman Michael Kogan in Tokyo as Taito Trading Company. The company started importing, leasing, and later developing amusement machines in the 1960s. The company's current name of Taito Corporation was adopted in 1972. Taito was among the first makers of electronic games, selling their own Pong clone in 1973. The company became a major player in 1978 after the enormous success of Space Invaders, and continues to be involved in a wide variety of arcade and home game development to this day. Two North American divisions were later started, Taito America in Elk Grove Village, IL in 1973, and later Taito Software in North Vancouver, BC in 1988. The Vancouver studio was shut down by 1991 and North American operations moved back to Wheeling, IL where Taito America had relocated back in 1985. In July, 1996 Taito also closed its American branch as the company focused its efforts on the domestic Japanese market, licensing its titles to other publishers such as Acclaim for international markets. In August 2005, it was announced that Square Enix had made a bid to take majority ownership of Taito. The deal was approved and completed by the end of September, making Taito a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square Enix.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/5ad5600e-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1973,2025,Japan
Bandai Namco Entertainment UK Ltd.,"Bandai Namco Entertainment UK Ltd. is the United Kingdom branch office of BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc., responsible for the distribution of Bandai Namco games into Europe - but even before that, it was one of the most successful European gaming companies of its time, as Ocean Software Limited. Founded in 1983 as Spectrum Games and based in Manchester, England, Ocean was a hugely successful label up to the mid-90s, operating mainly on home computer systems. Ocean was responsible for a huge amount of arcade conversions, ports from other platforms, re-releases (mainly through their label The Hit Squad) and also original PC games. They released many film-licensed games, most of which involved either several different sections  loosely resembling a part of the film, or walking left-to-right and shooting. Although widely ridiculed, these titles did extremely well, and helped fund their arcade conversion licenses and original products. However, once the Atari ST and Amiga scene faded, Ocean struggled to establish themselves on the newer systems, and were ultimately bought out by Infogrames. The last game published by the company as Ocean was GT 64: Championship Edition for the Nintendo 64 in April 1998. After that, it became Infogrames United Kingdom Limited, and then Atari UK Ltd. in 2003. The company served as Infogrames/Atari's UK branch office until 2009, when Bandai Namco, who was a minority owner of Distribution Partners along with Atari SA, acquired both Atari UK Ltd. (as well as most related regional offices) and Atari SA's stake in Distribution Partners.

"Sierra Entertainment, Inc.","Early Days Founded in 1980 as On-Line Systems, the company began when Ken Williams took on the daunting task of programming his wife Roberta's hand-written game concept into the first graphic/text adventure game ever created. Dubbed Hi-Res Adventure #1: Mystery House, the game's marriage of text and graphics became the product upon which all other graphics adventures were measured. The success of the game allowed Ken and Roberta to move out of Los Angeles, first to Coarsegold, later to Oakhurst, California. Relating to their new location at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the company changed its name to Sierra On-Line in 1982. Soon after the success of Mystery House, Roberta Williams created her second adventure game, the Wizard and the Princess, which sold more than sixty thousand copies; a substantial sell through for the early 1980s. Like her previous game, it set the industry standard for home computer entertainment. The following years brought many similar successes. Sierra's most popular series, King's Quest, earned international recognition and numerous industry awards. To date the series has sold more than 3 million copies, making Roberta Williams one of the best-selling computer game designers in the industry. Over the years Sierra On-Line, Inc. has had some of the best-selling game series that can be directly attributed to some of the best-known names in computer game development. Including renowned designers Roberta Williams (King's Quest), David Lester (Lords of the Realm, Caesar), Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight), David Kaemmer (Indy Car, NASCAR Racing), Jeff Tunnell (Starsiege) and Al Lowe (Leisure Suit Larry). Acquisitions A series of acquisitions has helped Sierra expand its development expertise into additional categories including sports, simulations, strategy, home productivity, and casual entertainment.  Founded in 1984 by Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye, Dynamix became a member of the Sierra family in 1990. Dynamix then expanded its product line to include the multi-award winning Red Baron, Aces of the Pacific and Aces over Europe. In addition to the flight sim titles of those earlier years, Dynamix published family titles (Incredible Machine and 3-D Ultra Pinball). Dynamix has developed products for three of Sierra's family of brands: Sierra Attractions (3-D Ultra’ line), Sierra Sports (Trophy Bass), and Dynamix, a Sierra Company (flight simulations and action games). Bright Star Technologies entered the Sierra family in 1992. Founded by Elon Gasper, inventor of HyperAnimation and the principal author of Alphabet Blocks, Bright Star is a key player in multimedia technology. In addition to the well-known Talking Tutors series, Bright Star has developed multimedia language programs such as Berlitz Live! Spanish and Berlitz Live! Japanese. Sierra's 1993 acquisition of Coktel Vision, a Paris-based developer and publisher of education and entertainment software, added titles such as Goblins and the Inca series to the Sierra family of products. 1995 saw a number of acquisitions, primarily in the home productivity genre. In May, Sierra purchased the rights to Print Artist, a program that enables users to quickly and easily create and print their own professional-quality documents. The acquisition of Green Thumb Software contributed home gardening and landscape products to the company's growing home productivity line. Arion software, publisher of the acclaimed MasterCook culinary series, was folded into the Sierra family in September. During 1995, Sierra purchased Impressions Games, a leading publisher of strategy games. Known for such products as Caesar II, Caesar III, Lords of the Realm, High Seas Trader and The Blue and The Gray, Impressions improved Sierra's strategy game offerings. Sierra also purchased Papyrus Design Group and SubLogic in 1995. Papyrus, was primarily known for its racing simulations was the developer of NASCAR Racing. SubLogic developed flight simulation software within Dynamix.  Sierra completed two acquisitions in April of 1997. The first was Berkeley Systems, publishers of the You Don't Know Jack series and the commercially successful After Dark screensaver series and the popular bezerk network. Books That Work also joined the Sierra family. Books That Work develops software that guides users through the design, visualization and building processes of home-related projects, such as landscapes, gardens, decks, kitchens, and entire houses. Its best-known titles include 3D Deck, 3D Kitchen, 3D Landscape, and Visual Home. Sierra sold to CUC International In 1996, Sierra was sold for $1.06 billion in stock to CUC International. The acquisition, announced on February 20, 1996, was completed on July 24, 1996. By then CUC (Comp-U-Card) International was a Stamford, Connecticut based, technology-driven retail and membership services company that provided access to travel, shopping, auto, dining, home improvement, financial, and other services to nearly 40 million consumers worldwide. Chairman of CUC was Walter Forbes, one of the members of the board of Sierra. Cendant merger A year later Sierra became part of Cendant Software, at that time one of the largest PC consumer software groups in the world. On December 18, 1997, CUC merged with HFS Incorporated and became Cendant Corporation. Cendant Software consolidated the sales, manufacturing, finance, accounting and management of Cendant Corporation's software divisions, including Sierra, Knowledge Adventure, Davidson & Associates, Inc. and Blizzard Entertainment. Havas Interactive Acquisition and Afterwards In January 1999, Sierra and its affiliates were acquired by Havas, S.A. Through the acquisition, Cendant Software became Havas Interactive. Its holdings were, Blizzard, Coktel, Knowledge Adventure, Sierra, and WON.net. Havas Interactive had operations in the US and in Europe and is a subsidiary of the French publishing house Havas, part of Vivendi Communications. In June 2000, Havas Interactive was reformed as Vivendi Universal and on October 2001, Sierra's logo was reverted to the famous Half-Dome logo. Afterwards, on 19 February 2002, Sierra On-Line was renamed to Sierra Entertainment. The year 2004, however, was a bad year for Sierra. Sierra's parent company, Vivendi Universal Games, decided to take cost-cutting measures and the former subsidiaries of Sierra, all renowned companies such as Impressions and Papyrus were shut down in spring of 2004, while Sierra's HQ in Bellevue was shut down in June of the same year for good. From then on, Sierra became a label of Vivendi Universal Games. However, in late 2005, Sierra was relaunched, this time from Los Angeles, with a new brand, Sierra Online, for indie publishing purposes. Also, new companies that acquired by Vivendi Games were joined to the Sierra family, including High Moon, Radical, Swordfish, Massive and Secret Lair, with the latter renamed to Sierra Online Seattle and Sierra Online Shanghai (Chinese division of Secret Lair), respectively. Also, some Vivendi Games properties, most notably Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, were transferred to Sierra. In July 2008, however, Vivendi Games was merged with Activision that resulted to a new holding company, Activision Blizzard, making Sierra redundant. On October 2008, Sierra was disbanded, with majority of it's subsidiaries, with the exception of High Moon and Radical, are either closed or sold, with all of their in-development titles at the time were either cancelled or published under the Activision brand. Revival of the Sierra brand In August 2014, the website of Sierra was updated, with a new logo and a text, saying that they would be on GamesCom 2014. Afterwards, Sierra, this time a continuation of the former Sierra Online division rather than Sierra itself, has unveiled two games - Geometry Wars 3 and King's Quest, slated to be released in 25 November 2014 and 2015, respectively.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/1252f922-ab6c-11ed-93d8-02420a000198.webp,1980,2017,United States

"Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.","Hudson Soft Company was a Japanese game developer and publisher. They also developed video game peripherals and mobile content, and recorded music. The company was founded on May 18th, 1973, by the brothers Yūji and Hiroshi Kudō. The company was named after Hudson locomotives due to its founders' love of trains. It was initially a shop called CQ Hudson, which sold radio telecommunications devices and art photographs. In September 1975 Hudson began focusing on computer-related products, and in March 1978 they started developing computer games. Most of their early titles had little success, but things changed with the release of Bomberman (1983), which eventually became one of their flagship series. Among their other popular franchises are Adventure Island, Bonk's Adventure, and Tengai Makyō series (developed in cooperation with RED Company).  The company was well-known for its shoot 'em ups, for which it arranged tournaments called carnivals each year. Albeit a strong supporter of Nintendo's Famicom, the company went on to develop the PC Engine together with NEC.

Gameloft S.E.,"Gameloft is a French company established on 1 December 1999 as Gameloft.com S.A. On 30 November 2001, the name was changed to Gameloft S.A. The company was founded as a partnership between Ubi Soft (game development and publishing) and Guillemot Corporation (multimedia products), with seven people from the Guillemot family as shareholders. It was formed with the aim to develop, publish and distribute games and product for mobile devices and interactive television. On 1 October 2001, the whole of Ludigames S.A. (another company set up by the Guillemot family) merged with Gameloft S.A. and was absorbed into that company. Michel Guillemot took over the managing roles of the new fused company from his brother Gérard Guillemot. The merger was needed because Gameloft could not create the needed profit based on web activities (66,600,000 € net loss in the fiscal year 2001) and Ludigames, despite the larger scope with PDA and SMS), was not profitable either. After the merger, some but not all of Ludigames' many offices became Gameloft divisions. By June 2003, Gameloft employed 110 people at eight subsidiaries:  Gameloft S.A. (France) Jeuxvideo.com (France) Gameloft Inc. (USA) Gameloft Divertissements Inc. (Canada) Gameloft.com AG (Germany) Gameloft Ltd. (United Kingdom) Gameloft GmbH (Germany) Gameloft Iberica S.A. (Spain) Gameloft Srl (Romania)  Some offices were closed as well: Gameloft.com Ltd. (UK), Gameloft.com Srl (Italy) and Gameloft KK (Japan, formerly Ludigames KK). After the merger Gameloft gave web products as the sole focus a lower priority and quickly went on to define its core business as JAVA and BREW game titles. With Ubisoft as an important partner, many of Gameloft's mobile games are based on popular franchises such as Rayman, Splinter Cell, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed. Much of the work was done in office in Eastern Europe and China. Some of these divisions include:  Gameloft Bulgaria EOOD Gameloft China Gameloft Software Pvt. Ltd. (sold to Ubisoft Entertainment SA in 2008)  The company also owns and maintains jeuxvideo.com - a popular French games website. By July 2007, Ubisoft disposed of the 18.89% interest it owned in Gameloft to Calyon, investment bank, under an equity swap agreement. On 1 June 2016, Gameloft was acquired by the French mass media company Vivendi through a hostile takeover by acquiring Ubisoft's stakes in the company.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/1f8556ae-655e-11f0-a058-02420a000113.webp,2000,2025,France

Mindscape SA,"Mindscape, as we know it now, is the result of a turbulent change of events spanning 15 years which took the company on a rollercoaster ride, soaring it to huge success, plummeting it to the brink of extinction and back again. Roger M. Buoy, previously an Executive Vice President with Scholastic, Inc., founded Mindscape, Inc. in 1983. Located in Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Mindscape, Inc. was a very successful publisher and distributor of Commodore, Amiga and DOS games as well as educational software and applications. In 1986/87, Mindscape acquired software companies Scarborough Systems, Learning Well, and CBS Interactive Learning. In March 1990, The Software Toolworks of Novato, California, acquired Mindscape, moved it to California and set it up as an independently operated division. The deal, worth $40 million, included Mindscape's licensing arrangement to design game cartridges for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Mindscape founder Roger Buoy remained on board but stepped down from management in 1992.  On 11 April 1994, The Software Toolworks and Mindscape, Inc. were acquired by London-based media group Pearson, plc for about $500 million. The resulting company was renamed Mindscape, Inc. once again. Acquisitions by Mindscape, Inc. while Pearson, plc owned the company included Strategic Simulations Inc. (SSI) (in Oct. 1994), which operated as a development subsidiary, and MicroLogic Software, Inc. (in Sept. 1995). Pearson, plc formed Mindscape Online Publishing for digital publishing and distributing during this period. In 1995, these office locations were listed in a press release, and the company was referred to as Mindscape Entertainment:  Azusa, California Northridge, California Naperville, Illinois Mindscape International Ltd. (West Sussex, England) Mindscape International GmbH (Kaarst/Ruhr/Dusseldorf, Germany) Paris, France Castle Hill, Australia  In 1997, Mindscape was reported as headquartered in Novato, Calif., with offices in Canada, England, France, Germany, Japan and Australia. The next couple of years caused the most upheaval for Mindscape. In a nutshell, Mindscape was bought and sold three times in the span of three years. First acquired by The Learning Company (TLC) (1998), then sold to Mattel, the toy company, along with TLC (1999), and TLC/Mindscape was sold yet again to the Gore Technology Group (2000). (See the History items for more details.) Luckily most of the Mindscape companies and divisions were kept separate as a unit and did not get absorbed by any other entity. The only exception to this was the United States location in Novato, California, which became part of The Learning Company somewhere along the way. Mindscape's ultimate salvation came in 2001 when Frenchman Jean-Pierre Nordman, formerly managing director of TLC's international division TLC Edusoft, came forth and acquired all of the Mindscape subsidiaries from the Gore Technology Group. Former executives of The Learning Company (TLC), Brøderbund Software and Mindscape joined the company with Nordman as CEO. They named it Mindscape SA. Mindscape SA was headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, France, a suburb west of Paris. The company specialized in the editing and publishing of educational and recreational software in three principal products lines: youth-oriented games, family oriented games and educational software. Following poor results in the 2000s, the company announced its exit from the games industry on 10 August 2011, and was liquidated on 24 August 2011. The Australian and Dutch subsidiaries were unaffected by this. The Dutch subsidiary Mindscape B.V. subsequently took over core operations. Mindscape SA subsidiaries:  Mindscape Asia Pacific Pty Ltd.

Interplay Entertainment Corp.,"Interplay is a North American video game developer and publisher based in Beverly Hills, California. It was founded in 1983 by Brian Fargo and initially consisted of three programmers: Jay Patel, Troy Worrell, and Bill Heineman, who previously worked with Fargo at Boone Corporation. Interplay initially developed text adventures, utilizing a text parser created by Fargo. They went on to produce The Bard's Tale series and other notable role-playing games such as Wasteland (1988). Interplay played a major role during the ""RPG revival"" period in the late 1990s. They developed Fallout (1997) and also hosted Black Isle Studios, which developed its sequel and worked on other role-playing games. Interplay would also publish multiple games based on the Dungeons & Dragons and Star Trek licenses, as well as the Descent, Freespace, Earthworm Jim and MDK properties, among others. Interplay Entertainment Corp., a member of the IDSA and Consumer Product Council, released products through Interplay, 14° East, Shiny Entertainment, Tantrum Entertainment, Black Isle Studios, VR Sports, Flat Cat, its affiliated labels and its wholly owned subsidiary Interplay OEM, Inc. Until 1997, they released Macintosh titles through MacPlay. The company was acquired by Titus Interactive in May 2000, with Hervé Caen serving as CEO since. It was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange on 9 October 2002. In May 2004, the company dissolved its remaining development divisions amid the financial troubles of Titus Interactive. The company vacated its Irvine, California office around that time, but still existed legally and tried to continue development of a Fallout MMO game with external developers. On 9 April 2007, Interplay sold the Fallout IP to Bethesda Softworks, but retained the right to license an MMO game in the franchise. This transfer would be further extended to all previous titles and the potential MMO on 10 January 2012 after a legal battle. Their Black Isle Studios, relaunched in 22 August 2012, was to develop Project V13 (Fallout Online) under license from Bethesda, but would stop updating in early 2014. In 2008, the company would start selling games again, becoming one of the first publishers to list games on GOG.com. On 24 September 2010, the company sued TopWare Interactive over the game Battle vs. Chess, claiming that it infringed their Battle Chess trademark. In 2012, they would win the case and receive US$ 200,000 with interest, and the game would be renamed to Check vs. Mate in North America. After a relatively quiet period in the 2010s, the company would reactivate its website in the early 2020s, announcing the animated series Earthworm Jim: Beyond the Groovy, relaunching the Black Isle Studios label for the third time to port Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II for PC and newer consoles, and license out Kingpin: Reloaded.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/34358eaa-b881-11ef-8ab8-02420a00011d.webp,1985,2025,United States

Bethesda Softworks LLC,"Bethesda Softworks LLC is a Rockville, Maryland, based game developer and publisher which was founded in 1986 by Christopher Weaver. In 1994, the company became known as the ""entertainment software division"" of Media Technology Limited, an international engineering research and development firm founded by members of the Architecture Machine Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), of which Chris Weaver was CEO. From Christopher Weaver (Jan 29, 2002):  ""I founded Bethesda in 1986. To the best of our knowledge (and Johnny Wilson agrees with this so you can assume this information is reasonably accurate) we invented physics-based sports games. Our Gridiron! football program (for Amiga and Atari) was not statistically based but built to incorporate a bounded system of man-made rules operating within a physics-based world engine. So impressive was this novel system that Trip Hawkins, then President of Electronic Arts, asked Bethesda to become an affiliate and help design their ""new"" football game, John Madden Football."" ""So, the best selling football game of all time was based in part upon Bethesda's design and physics-based approach to its Gridiron! game."" ""Similarly, Bethesda created the Terminator series, years before id came up with Doom, and also introduced The Elder Scrolls series of RPG's starting with Arena, then Daggerfall and the soon-to-be-released (March/April 2002) third chapter, Morrowind. The Elder Scrolls series set new standards for large scale role-playing and influenced the RPG community in everything from single player to massively multiplayer games that were to follow."" ""You may also be interested to learn that Bethesda Softworks is one of the last surviving private software publishers that was one of the original industry veterans in the 1980's such as EA, Origin, Sierra, Legend, etc. The fact that Bethesda is still publishing hit games (such as Morrowind) 17 years after its founding says a lot. While others around it have died or been swallowed up, Bethesda keeps marching to its own drummer...""  In 1999, Bethesda was acquired by ZeniMax Media Inc. when Media Technology Limited sold its stock to get additional development funds. Weaver and Robert Altman were the founders of the successor company. The company's internal development division is Bethesda Game Studios and was established in 2001.  On 21 September 2020, Microsoft acquired Bethesda and all its studios.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/e8c09e34-e782-11ef-898d-02420a000172.webp,1986,2025,United States

The company is most noted for publishing franchises such as the Disciples series, select Jagged Alliance titles, the original Europa Universalis, Gun Metal, the Space Empires series, Galactic Civilizations (2003), O.R.B.: Off-World Resource Base and others. In 2003, the company opened the short-lived budget game division/label Big City Games. On 18 August 2004, the company filed for bankruptcy due to its debt rising to US$ 5 million by May of that year.

Over the next 17 years, the company became a leading worldwide developer, publisher and mass marketer. The company's headquarters were located in Glen Cove, New York and their common stock publicly traded on the US Stock Exchange (NASDAQ symbol AKLM). Through their subsidiaries in North America, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, and Australia, the company distributed their software products directly to retailers and other outlets. They also utilized regional distributors in Japan and the Pacific Rim to distribute software within those geographic areas. In addition, the company was the distributor for other publishers worldwide. A smaller portion of their business included publishing gaming strategy guides and issuing special edition comic magazines to support brands they owned, including Turok and Shadow Man. The demise of the company began in 2003, when the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation into several video game companies, including Acclaim. Lawsuits were filed in March 2003 against the company in US District Court alleging ""violations against the Securities Exchange Act of 1934"". In June 2003, CEO Gregory Fischbach stepped down as chief executive and was replaced by President Rodney Cousens. The end of Acclaim came when they filed Chapter 7, Title 11 (United States Bankruptcy Code). All divisions and studios were closed and assets liquidated by the end of 2004. Legal battles were fought in various courts all the way into mid-2007. However, the name Acclaim has not died. During the liquidation period in September 2004, former Activision CEO Howard Marks purchased the Acclaim name and the logo for a reported US$ 100,000. Then in 2006, he and Neil Malhotra created a new company naming it Acclaim Games with an entirely different focus: Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games.

Empire Interactive Europe Ltd.,"Empire Interactive Europe Ltd. was co-founded as Empire Software in 1987 by Simon Jeffrey and Ian Higgins in the United Kingdom. The company had a long and illustrious history and remained at the forefront of computer games development and publication for over a decade. Empire began by publishing, developing and distributing PC games and then added console games to their catalog later. The world recognized the Empire Interactive Entertainment publishing brand as the collective name of the company, when in reality the entity responsible for the releases was Empire Interactive Europe Ltd., the company name adopted about the same time the brand was created in 1989. However, the name Empire Software continued to be used as late as 1994 to identify the company on game packaging. Empire Interactive had several budget labels used mostly for re-packaging and re-publishing earlier released games. Fair Game was used in the 1990's, but the mainstay of the company was their lucrative Xplosiv label which was started in 2000 and remained popular. Major changes took place in 2000 with a restructuring of the company. Parent company Empire Interactive PLC (formerly Merithope Limited and Entertainment International plc) was re-registered, renamed and joined the Alternative Investment Market of London Stock Exchange in July. The company had operations in every major territory in the world, and a staff dedicated to each key link in the publishing and distribution chain. However, all development of products took place through Empire Interactive Europe Limited. European sales and distribution were the responsibility of four staff members based in this office in London, its head office. A further team of five designers organized the localisation of all software and marketing materials, translation being sub-contracted to external translators. The majority of Empire's UK sales were made directly to retailers. Subsidiaries in the Empire Group were located in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Distributors in Australia and South Africa sold its titles under the Empire Interactive Entertainment label in those countries. In the United States, publishing and distribution was handled by sister company Empire Interactive Inc. which had several locations. Acquisitions and merges in Empire's history include Oxford Enterprises, Cunning Developments and Razorworks, all of which became internal development studios. (Empire Oxford may have been comprised of employees from several of these acquired companies.) Empire also acquired Rowan Software. In 2004, the company also used the names Empire Interactive Ltd. and Empire Publishing Ltd. In 2006 the entire Empire Group was acquired by Silverstar Holdings, an acquisition company based in the United Kingdom which also owned Strategy First. In 2008 founder Ian Higgins, then the CEO, left Empire. A year later, in May 2009, Empire entered into administration and closed down.

Lucasfilm Games,"LucasArts was founded in May 1982 as Lucasfilm Games Group, the video game development group split off of Lucasfilm Computer Division( the computer special effects division of Lucasfilm Ltd.). The group was created by a joint agreement between Lucasfilm Ltd. and Atari; Atari paid US$1 million as seed money and, in return, got first right of refusal on publishing any game they developed. The first titles developed by Lucasfilm Games were Ballblazer and Rescue on Fractalus!, action games published in 1984 by Atari. At the time Lucasfilm Games were forbidden from developing Star Wars games because Lucasfilm Ltd. made more money licensing the franchise out to other game publishers. The ""first generation"" of Lucasfilm Games employees were Peter Langston, David Fox, Charlie Kellner, Dave Levine, and Gary Winnick. Loren Carpenter, technically a member of Lucasfilm Computer Division, was ""loaned"" to Lucasfilm Games to program the fractal landscapes of Rescue on Fractalus!. The release of Maniac Mansion (1987), an adventure game that introduced the SCUMM engine, was the starting point of the company's ""Golden Age"", during which it established itself as one of the leading adventure game developers. Secret of Monkey Island (1990) consolidated the company's adventure game design philosophy, including ""death-free"" gameplay, interaction with highlighted objects, and branching dialogue system. Later in the same year, a restructuring of Lucas' companies led to the video game division's name change to LucasArts.  Holding the licenses to the popular movie franchises Star Wars and Indiana Jones, LucasArts also developed games based on these movies. Their first Star Wars game was the space combat simulator X-Wing (1993). In 1995, LucasArts produced Star Wars: Dark Forces, which incorporated the Star Wars license with the nascent first-person shooter genre and started its own series.  The adventure legacy began to decline with the release of Grim Fandango in 1998. It received raving press reviews, but turned out to be the first game the company did not make a profit from. Escape from Monkey Island (2000) marked the end of the company's adventure era. From then on, almost all effort was diverted towards the Star Wars license. Most development was also outsourced, especially to the British development studio Traveller's Tales Ltd. A large amount of staff was laid off in June 2008, although the company still has projects in development at its internal development studio. Along with its parent company Lucasfilm Ltd., LucasArts was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in October 2012. The development division was then shut down on 3 April 2013, cancelling all projects and laying off all staff, with the exception of a skeleton crew. LucasArts has since became a small publishing/licensing company. It was fully re-established as a label for Star Wars-licensed games on 11 January 2021.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/41aa08e0-bc84-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1985,2026,United States
"Humble Bundle, Inc.","Humble Bundle, Inc. is a digital storefront for video games, which grew out of its original offering of Humble Bundles, collections of games sold at a price determined by the purchaser and with a portion of the price going towards charity and the rest split between the game developers. Humble Bundle continues to offer these limited-time bundles, but have expanded to include a greater and more persistent storefront. The Humble Bundle concept was initially run by Wolfire Games in 2010, but by its second bundle, the Humble Bundle company was spun out to manage the promotion, payments, and distribution of the bundles. In October 2017, the company was acquired by Ziff Davis through its IGN Entertainment subsidiary, though operates as a separate subsidiary. Initial bundles were typically collections of independently developed games featuring multi-platform support (including Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms) provided without digital rights management (DRM). Occurring every few months, the two-week Humble Bundles drew media attention, with several bundles surpassing $1 million in sales. Subsequently, the bundles became more frequent and expanded to include games from established developers, AAA publishers, games for Android-based devices, bundles promoting game jams, and bundles featuring digital copies of music, books and comic books. Bundles are presently offered on a more regular basis, with a persistent storefront for individual game sales. The Humble Bundle offerings support a number of charities, including Action Against Hunger, Child's Play, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, charity: water, the American Red Cross, WaterAid and the Wikimedia Foundation. By the end of October 2014, participating developers had grossed more than $100 million and by June 2019, the total charitable amount raised by the Bundles exceeded $150 million across 50 different charities. The success of the Humble Bundle approach has inspired a number of similar efforts to offer ""pay what you want"" bundles for smaller titles, including Indie Gala and Indie Royale. As a corporation, Humble Bundle is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with about 60 employees.

"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","When wargame giant Avalon Hill and then-current computer game publishers were not interested in his first title, Joel Billings had to found his own company to publish and distribute his computer wargames. SSI was the dominant force in computer wargames from then (1981) into the early 1990s, holding its own against Avalon Hill's own efforts and other competitors. In the mid 1980s, two of SSI's more prolific developers left to form their own company, SSG. The split appears to have been at least as much a result of the two living in Australia as of any business or creative reasons. In the late 1980s, SSI signed a deal with TSR, Inc., to publish official Dungeons and Dragons computer games. The ""Gold Box"" D&D games took the company in new directions. Although SSI never stopped publishing war games, the D&D license quickly became the main source of income and produced their best-known products. The loss of the D&D license to Interplay was the swan song for SSI as an independent company. No longer dominant in their original wargame market and suddenly without their primary franchise, the company was acquired by Mindscape in 1994. It changed hands several times after that - from Mindscape to The Learning Company, Mattel Interactive, The Gores Group and finally to Ubi Soft on 7 March 2001. Ubi Soft used the SSI logo and name on some of their titles, including Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor and Destroyer Command, but has retired the brand around 2002.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/216ca2dc-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1980,2023,Australia

Their sole project was Computer Space before the company was incorporated as Atari, Inc. in 1972 (California). Atari quickly became one of the biggest players in the US arcade industry and was bought by Warner Communications, Inc. in 1976. Technically it was merged with WCI Games, Inc, a Time Warner subsidiary which was founded three months earlier for that purpose, and the business was continued by a new company also named Atari, Inc. (1977, New York county).  Atari continued to thrive with the introduction of its VCS console (1977) and their 8-Bit home computer systems (1979), but were hit hard by the videogame crash of 1983. This lead to the sale of the consumer and computer divisions to Tramel Technology (founded by the former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel for that purpose) in 1984. The new company was Atari Corporation. The arcade business remained at Time Warner as Atari Games Corporation. This entity (after briefly being called Atari Games, Inc. between 1984 and 1985) became Atari Holdings, Inc.until it was dissolved in 1992.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d3465416-bc75-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1971,2023,United States

Zen Stúdió Kft,"Zen Studios (originally called RUBIK Interactive for a short time) was founded by a team of four in 2003 as a work for hire studio that developed engines, tools and ports for other titles. After establishing a financial footing, CEO Zsolt Kigyossy decided to take his love of pinball and task the team with creating a high quality pinball simulation. The result was the Pinball FX series, which continues to this day and has had a large number of entries across many platforms, as well as myriad add-on tables, many based on licensed properties and real-world pinball machines. Though most well known for pinball games, Zen has created a number of generally well received original titles in various genres, like the CastleStorm tower defence series, rhythm martial arts game KickBeat and grid-based dungeon crawler Operencia: The Stolen Sun. In November, 2020, Embracer Group announced that they had acquired Zen Studios through their Saber Interactivesubsidiary, which would be its parent. After financial struggles, Embracer sold Saber to Beacon Interactive (headed by Saber co-founder Matthew Karch in March, 2024, as part of a corporate restructuring effort.

Atari Corporation,"Atari Corporation was formed in 1984 when Jack Tramiel bought the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. from Warner Communications and merged it with his own company, Tramel Technology Ltd. (TTL). Jack Tramiel was the former CEO of Commodore International which had been recently ousted. During this time, he stopped all of their game and console development and focused only on developing computers. Jack Tramiel hired many of the engineers from Commodore to join him, however these engineers were sued by Commodore for stealing computer designs that were used in Commodore computers, and Commodore won. Atari also sued Commodore and Amiga Corp. for breach of contract, which was eventually settled out of court. Atari came up with the Atari ST computer, which stopped the net losses at Atari, the ST sold 4 million units, mostly in Europe, it did not fare as well in the USA. This success gave Atari more financial leverage, so Atari got into marketing the handheld console, the Atari Lynx (which was developed by Epyx). The Lynx had very good technical abilities, however it drained the batteries required for it very quickly, and they had a shortage of parts when a person needed it repaired. It was also more expensive than the Nintendo Game Boy and had less aggressive marketing strategies that the Game Boy had and did not have the third party development that the Game Boy and the SEGA Game Gear had. Atari then proceeded to develop a 64-bit CD Based console, the Atari Jaguar, which was expensive on the market. It did not fare well in the beginning of it's introduction, and after the SEGA Saturn, Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 came out, the Jaguar was a complete failure because of its inability to compete with these systems. The Tramiel family eventually pulled out of the business and sold their stock to JTS Inc., but Atari does not exist anymore. The company and its intellectual properties were acquired by Hasbro Interactive on 13 March 1998. The Atari name was briefly used as a label for select games in 1999. After Infogrames acquired Hasbro Interactive in 2001, they first used the Atari brand for select titles in late 2002, then renamed the bulk of their subsidiaries to Atari on 6 May 2003.

"MicroProse Software, Inc.","MicroProse Software, Inc. was founded by Sid Meier and Bill Stealey in 1982, after the two had met working at General Instrument, a large electronic component manufacturer. They shared a passion for games, and Meier would design the games while Stealey would take care of marketing and administrative duties. In the initial years, the company focused on combat flight simulators and military strategy games. 1990 marked an important turning point with the release of Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon, the first non-destructive god game for the company. This contrasted with the military-oriented view of the other founder, Bill Stealey, who wanted to enter the market of home game consoles and arcade video games, which Sid Meier did not like. In the meantime, Stealey had bought out Meier and Sid Meier had become a private contractor, working exclusively for the company. He received money up front, more when the game delivered and royalties on each sold copy. MicroProse continued to back Sid Meier's games, yet they wanted him to work on other types of games as well, delaying the release of Sid Meier's Civilization, which Sid was working on most of the time. When the game was finally released, favorable reviews and some great marketing by Fred Schmidt, VP Marketing, gave the game a major boost, surprising management and the creators themselves. In the meantime, the firm was sinking into a hole of debt. They released 2 arcade games in the 1990s which did not fare well, leading to an IPO for cash. In 1993, Stealey approached Gilman Louie, head of Spectrum Holobyte, Inc., and asked him to buy MicroProse rather than letting it fall into unknown hands. After the acquisition, eventually Bill Stealey left and founded Interactive Magic in 1994. After a major staff cut in 1996 and consolidation of internal studios (including the disbanding of the MPS Labs division), Sid Meier left the company with Brian Reynolds and Jeff Briggs and founded Firaxis Games. Soon afterwards, Spectrum Holobyte would rename itself MicroProse (possibly known internally as MicroProse Alameda).  Noted legal issues occurred in 1997 over the Civilization license, as the company Avalon Hill published the board game of the same name in North America. MicroProse would acquire the board game's rightsholder, Hartland Trefoil, on 2 December 1997, solidifying their ownership of the license. However, at the same time, they would dispute with Activision due to the latter's Civilization: Call to Power game that was in development. The issue was settled on 14 July 1998, permitting Activision to use the Civilization name for only one game and preventing Avalon Hill any further licensing. On 5 October 1997, GT Interactive approached to acquire MicroProse, but the deal was cancelled on 5 December 1997 over disagreements in handling financial compensations to developers. On 12 August 1998, the company received a tender offer for acquisition by Hasbro Interactive, which was completed on 15 September 1998. The company name was retained under Hasbro Interactive's ownership. On 7 December 1999, the Alameda and Chapel Hill studios were shut down as part of Hasbro Interactive's restructuring; they were working on Master of Magic 2 and X-COM: Genesis, respectively, both of which were cancelled. MicroProse ceased to exist as a label when Hasbro was acquired by Infogrames in 2001. However, the internal development studio in Hunt Valley would release two more games, X-COM: Enforcer and Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes, before closing on 5 November 2003. The company used the publishing label Microplay Software for externally-developed games. The name and brand were acquired by Interactive Game Group in 2007, eventually bought and reused by MicroProse Software Pty Ltd as of 2019. They would only acquire select intellectual properties of the original MicroProse (including Carrier Command, B-17 Flying Fortress and eventually Falcon).",https://cdn.mobygames.com/08241c88-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1982,2024,
Krome Studios Pty Ltd.,"The Australian-based Krome Studios was originally established in 1999 as a joint venture between Gee Whiz! Entertainment (founded by John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis - who had also founded Interactive Binary Illusions in 1993) and another company (owned by Robert Walsh). Passfield and Stamatiadis met Walsh through their work on the title Mike Stewart’s Pro Bodyboarding (1999) and decided to continue together. Krome was established with the goal of creating original and licensed games for PC, console and later handheld, systems. John Passfield left the company after selling his shares in early 2005. He is the co-creator and designer of the TY the Tasmanian Tiger series.  From a humble team of five, Krome grew exponentially each year to become Australia's largest game development company. In its early days, Krome pioneered surfing games on the PlayStation with Championship Surfer and Sunny Garcia Surfing, utilising in-house technology. Following this, Krome produced a number of children's titles including games for the Barbie, Disney and Nickelodeon franchises. On 23rd March 2006 a second office was formally opened: Krome Studios Adelaide. From then on the main studio with the headquarters was often referred to as Krome Studio Brisbane. Half a year later, in November 2006, Krome Studios acquired Atari Melbourne House Pty Ltd., Australia's oldest development studio (known as Beam Software Pty., Ltd. in the eighties until the mid-nineties) and it was renamed Krome Studios Melbourne. On 18th August 2010 it became known the Adelaide office had been closed along with heavy cuts at the Brisbane and Melbourne offices. The studio (presumably along with the Melbourne office) was entirely closed on 15th October 2010. Its last title was Blade Kitten. A number of developers went on to work at the newly-founded development studio KMM Brisbane, but it was confirmed to be closed in October 2011, while the team was working on the unreleased title Happy Feet Two. In July 2012, Krome Studios re-opened their website, announcing that Ty the Tasmanian Tiger would return.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/8853ebf8-bc84-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,2000,2023,
Rebellion Developments Ltd.,"UK-based computer games developer Rebellion was established in 1991 by brothers Jason and Chris Kingsley. Since then it has expanded from a two-person outfit in the brothers' shared basement flat to a team of more than fifty programmers, artists and animators, and has moved into a new studio in central Oxford. The team consists mainly of Oxford University graduates, and several PhDs and MScs.

Throughout the many years of developing games, Rebellion has branched out into other media, most notably comics. In June 2000, Rebellion purchased the UK's premier sci-fi comic 2000 AD and its entire character portfolio consisting of characters such as Judge Dredd, Rogue Trooper, Strontium Dog, ABC Warriors and over 700 other unique and innovative IP's. In November 2003, Rebellion launched its first 2000 AD character game Judge Dredd: Dredd vs Death. Rogue Trooper was chosen as the second character to join the videogames arena.

Focusing on sci-fi/adventure/fantasy stories, Abaddon Books is scheduled to launch its first collection in the summer 2006. Adding to the media mix, Rebellion also produce movies through its Fearnort production house. Fearnort produced the 'alien-style' movie Parasite in 2004.

CI Games S.A.,"CI Games is a development and publishing company based in Poland with its headquarters in Warsaw. It was established in 2002 by Lemon Interactive (previously also called Coda), a company that mainly published budget titles but also had a development team.

(also called Oni Games), a separate sister company to City Interactive to publish and distribute externally developed titles, but with the same owners as City. In 2007 it was formally merged into City Interactive. The company name was changed from City Interactive to CI Games in August 2013. The development team was further made up out of members of Tatanka s.c., a studio that was initially a demo group and released Asy Przestworzy in 2002, a precursor to City's Wings of Honour series. A third studio at the core of City was We Open Eyes, another demo group that caught the attention of Lemon Interactive with Genocide, a project that would eventually become Project Earth: Starmageddon (2002). Next to the Warsaw headquarters, CI Games has four additional studios in Poland:  City Interactive Bydgoszcz (2010, full development studio) City Interactive Katowice (2006, support studio for content) City Interactive Poznań (2009, art assets for the other studios) City Interactive Rzeszów (2007, acquired as Detalion Art)  City Interactive established a studio in Romania:  City Interactive Studio S.r.l.

"Behaviour Interactive, Inc.","Behaviour Interactive is a game development studio originally founded in 1992 in Montreal, Québec, Canada. The current studio is the result of the 1997 merger of the game development studio Megatoon (founded in 1992) and Multimedia Interactive (founded in 1994). Both companies were previously acquired by Malofilm Communications in 1996 before they were turned into a single brand.

In November 2008, the company acquired the development studio Wanako Studios (based in Santiago, Chile) from Activision Blizzard. It was renamed Behaviour Interactive Chile Ltda. In October 2008 the company employed 450 people. In November 2010, the studio returned to its original name Behaviour Interactive. According to Racine people didn't remember ""Artificial Mind & Movement"" and they often had to explain what A2M meant. Also part of the decision was that the acronym A2M refers to a sexual act. It was not a problem earlier, but the acronym gained popularity from 2005 onwards. With the name change the company also specified that it now had five different internal divisions: gamer, portable, online, downloadable and family. Behaviour often develops games based on movie and cartoon licenses.

Psygnosis Limited,"Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher. The company was founded in Liverpool in 1984 from the ashes of Imagine, and initially developed games (mostly in the action genre) for Amiga and Atari ST. After their initial success with their early games, such as Brataccas, Psygnosis' biggest hit came with Lemmings, released in 1991 and spawned many sequels. This success led to the acquisition of the company by Sony Corporation on May 23, 1993. After the acquisition, in early 1995, Psygnosis retreated from the Amiga market, and just after several months, in September 1995, Psygnosis released WipeOut. WipeOut was Psygnosis' second biggest hit, after Lemmings. Like Lemmings, WipeOut has spawned many sequels.  Just after WipeOut was released, in late 1995, Psygnosis abandoned development on 16-bit platforms, leaving some games, like the Genesis port of Bill's Tomato Game, unreleased. Psygnosis also operated two labels: Psyclapse and Sizzlers. Psyclapse was a publishing label, and Sizzlers was a budget label, responsible for re-releasing old Psygnosis games. Both labels disappeared in the early 90's. The last of its subsidiaries was a studio, called Wheelhaus, closed in 1999-2000. In late 1998, Eidos Interactive bought Psygnosis' European operations. Psygnosis' US operations were folded into Sony's own development outfit, 989 Studios. Finally, in 2000, Psygnosis (as a Sony brand) abandoned the PC game market for good, with all games that in development at the time were either cancelled, moved to PlayStation, or licensed to different publishers. All US studios closed. The UK studios were absorbed by SCEE, renamed SCE Studio Liverpool and became part of the SCE Worldwide Studios.

Krome Studios Melbourne,"The original company Melbourne House (Publishers) Ltd. was founded in 1977 by Alfred Milgrom and Naomi Besen. Starting as a general publishing company, it soon focused on home computers. In August 1980 Melbourne House published one of the first books ever for the personal computer market and started to distribute games created in the US. In the same year, Milgrom and Besen founded Beam Software as a subsidiary, Australia's first electronic game company, initially focusing on development for the Sinclair ZX-80, and for the Sinclair ZX-81 since 1981. By 1982, Beam had become so successful that book publishing was phased out. Melbourne House started to concentrate solely on publishing Beam-created games. Beam developed the Horace series for the Spectrum and released The Hobbit in 1982. In 1983, Penetrator for the TRS-80 saw the light of day and the same year another development division, Studio B. Ltd., was set up in the UK. They moved into offices in Richmond in 1984. Despite very successful years in 1985 and 1986 with the sales of The Way of the Exploding Fist, Melbourne House ran into financial problems. In 1987, the UK publishing arm and the name Melbourne House were sold to Mastertronic Ltd., a publisher and distributor of low-budget games. Due to a contractual dispute between Beam and Mastertronic, none of the work developed in 1987 was published. Mastertronic itself became a part of Virgin Games, Ltd. and the name Melbourne House was held there. Beam became an independent entity. In 1989 Beam started development for the NEC PC-9801 and NEC PC-Engine, for the Japanese market, followed by the creation of CD-ROM games for the NEC PC-Engine in 1990. Two more games were completed that year: Hunt for Red October (GameBoy) and Star Wars (NES). In 1991, the Beam group started LaserBeam Entertainment, a subsidiary to publish Nintendo games, and it obtained a Nintendo License for the Australian market. That year, Super Smash TV (SNES) was released. In 1992, the company brought Aussie Rules Footy (NES) and International Cricket (NES) on the market in Australia, followed by two FASA-licensed games in 1993: ShadowRun and MechWarrior. In 1995 Beam released Cricket 96 and The Dame Was Loaded, and one year later it became the first publicly listed games company on the Australian Stock Exchange. When Virgin allowed the Melbourne House brand to lapse in 1996, Beam re-registered it and launched it as its publishing / game development subsidiary. In 1997, Beam released KKND: Krush, Kill 'N Destroy and Cricket 97. In 1999, Melbourne House was sold to Infogrames, which included the computer games division and Hotgames.com, a portal for games enthusiasts, to extinguish $12 million of debt. The next year, in 2000, Beam changed its name to Blaze International. The company started developing software and provided services for entertainment, telecommunications and Internet applications. From then on, Beam (Blaze) was no longer associated with the game industry and the story continued with the division sold to Infogrames, renamed Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd. Along with the acquisition of distributor Ozisoft the same year, Infogrames tried to gain foothold in both the Australian and Asian markets with these investments. Founder Alfred Milgrom and CEO / Managing Director, Adam Lancman resigned from the Board in April 2001, selling all of their 34 million shares. In 2002, Infogrames invested another $50 million in the division and in May 2003, due to a global rebranding, they renamed the company Atari Melbourne House Pty Ltd. In February 2006, Atari boss Bruno Bonnell announced his plan to sell off a few internal Atari studios due to the severe financial situation. Atari Melbourne House was included in the sale, even though it was on the brink of completing a new game, Test Drive Unlimited. In November 2006, the company was acquired by Krome Studios and renamed Krome Studios Melbourne. It was closed on 15 October 2010, along with the main Brisbane office. Next to the game development, Beam Software also had the division Smarty Pants Publishing Pty Ltd, that created software titles for kids, as well as the proprietary video compression technology VideoBeam, and Famous Faces, a facial motion capture hardware and software solution.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/b74d9b0a-72b9-11f0-8168-02420a000182.webp,1980,2022,Japan

"id Software, Inc.","Foundation id Software, based in Mesquite, Texas, is considered by many the godfather of 3D-based first person shooter games. The company's originators, John Carmack (programmer), John Romero (programmer/designer), Tom Hall (designer), Lane Roathe (programmer) and Adrian Carmack, were originally developers at Softdisk's Gamer Edge, a games division creating Apple II and PC games for monthly subscription issues, but they were also working on projects outside of the company. The early years In September 1990, programmer John Carmack was the first to recreate the smooth side-scrolling technique supported by Nintendo's NES hardware as seen in their Mario games. Since 1981, PC graphic adapters were able to do this, but Carmack was the first to uncover and use the hardware and invented a software method he called adaptive tile refresh. They used this concept to create a PC demo of Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES). Romero knew this was a major breakthrough, and he wanted to break away from Softdisk immediately. As not to interfere with their regular work, they secretly borrowed the company's computers in the weekends, and worked on their port on another location, along with the help of Jay Wilbur. They called themselves Ideas From the Deep, a name that Romero and Roathe had previously used for their collaborations. They sent the finished port to Nintendo of America in 1990, but it was turned down because Nintendo had no interest in entering the PC market. Some time after the demo, Romero was contacted by Scott Miller, who went through great lengths to get to the Gamer's Edge developers. He asked them to develop shareware games for his company Apogee, and they came up with Commander Keen, a trilogy, which they finished in December 1990, after working it in the evenings and at night, next to their day job developing games for Softdisk. Commander Keen was a major success, and as the first big money started to roll in, they decided to break away from Softdisk. The used up company time was revealed, and they had to write a new game every two months for Gamer's Edge to make up for it. Nevertheless, on 1 February 1991, id Software was born. For the name, they dropped the ""F"" from IFD (Ideas From the Deep). While Adrian Carmack, John Romero and John Carmack founded their company, Lane Roathe, who had been kept aside from the work on Commander Keen, left the group for Three-Sixty Pacific, Inc. as he wanted to go to California. Jay Wilbur and Tom Hall stayed at Softdisk. Their breakthrough game was Commander Keen in 1990. It would later evolve into two trilogies and an extra episode, comprising seven games in total. The company has always focused on franchises, but in the beginning they developed individual games in between. They also tended to offer large parts of the game as fully playable shareware. While working on 3D techniques, they fulfilled their Softdisk contract with innovative games such as Rescue Rover, Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion, Hovertank, and Keen Dreams. In December 1991, they finished the second set of Commander Keen games for Apogee and published, through FormGen, another Keen episode, Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter! Wolfenstein and Doom In 1992, the highly-acclaimed Wolfenstein 3D was released, and it was the starting point for id's focus on first-person shooters. After creating a sequel, Spear of Destiny (1992), they launched Doom in 1993. It revolutionized the genre with varying floor and ceiling heights, texture mapping and network / Internet play. 1994 brought the sequel Doom II, and both games became some of the best-selling games in history. Quake and franchises In 1995, the company started a new franchise with the game Quake. Released five months after Duke Nukem 3D's shareware version, Quake introduced a full 3D engine, Internet multiplayer, in-game console, and mouselook. The company has since developed sequels for its three main franchises: Quake II, Quake III: Arena, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Doom³ and Quake 4 with additional expansions. id Software also sold licenses to its engines, while providing for the community by releasing SDKs and the full engines' source code when it was no longer actively used. The main engine programmer, John Carmack, has become a prominent figure for his work on 3D engines, often advising graphics cards manufacturers. One of his latest accomplishments is the MegaTexturing technology introduced in Rage. Instead of creating separate textures and then tiling them, he made it possible to design large outdoor maps with varied environments with one monumentally large texture editable on a pixel-by-pixel basis, but requiring a smaller amount of memory. Regardless of this, the company has lost its trademark impact of raising the bar for other developers, generally since Quake III: Arena in 1999. The company organizes a yearly Quakecon LAN party where its products are honoured and showcased. id also expanded the Quake franchise with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, based on the success of the free multiplayer game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. Orcs & Elves was the company's first new intellectual property in more then ten years, since the release of Quake. On 1 August 2008, John Carmack revealed that the company had been working eighteen months on a survival horror title called Darkness. Development had begun straight after Doom³, but production was halted when they realized the game was covering ground id had previously tread. Under ZeniMax After many years of a publishing partnership with Activision, the company was acquired by ZeniMax Media on 24 June 2009, taking most of their intellectual properties with them. The Rage franchise was launched in 2010. Rage uses used id Software's id Tech 5 engine and was developed in-house to be released on multiple platforms (PC, Xbox 360, Mac and PlayStation 3). In that same year, the company also announced a new game in the Quake series: Quake Live (early on known as Quake Zero), a browser version of Quake III. A secondary studio was opened in Germany in 2015, in the offices of ZeniMax Germany. The company rebooted the Doom franchise with the successful Doom (2016), Doom Eternal (2020) and Doom: The Dark Ages (2025). Quake: Champions was released in early access in 2017 and fully in 2022. Meanwhile, the Wolfenstein franchise was handled by fellow ZeniMax subsidiary MachineGames instead of id Software. id Software would partner with Nvidia to release Quake II RTX in 2019, as well as Nightdive Studios and MachineGames to release enhanced versions of Quake (2021), Quake II (2023) and Doom + Doom II (2024).",https://cdn.mobygames.com/92ebbcd6-c44e-11ed-87a1-02420a000137.webp,1990,2025,United States
IndieGala S.r.l.,"IndieGala is a series of video game bundles similar to the Humble Bundle, but with games offered generally only for Microsoft Windows, and usually with digital rights management (DRM). The first IndieGala was released on December 5, 2011. The company's co-founder and CEO is Riccardo Rosapepe. Most games, so far, have been Steam keys and not direct downloads. Exceptions include, but are not limited to, Vizati in the first Gala, Fruit Blitz for Android in the second Gala, as well as the original Postal game for Mac, Linux and Windows, also in the second Gala. Similar to Humble Bundle, buyers can set the revenue split between the developers, charities and organizers. A peculiarity of the IndieGala bundles, which distinguishes it from other similar sites, is to give to music albums almost the same prominence as that given to the games. IndieGala also launched an initiative called Galafund that aims to support independent game development.

"Telltale, Inc.","Telltale, founded in October 2004, was a game studio based in San Rafael, USA. It was led by a trio of ex-LucasArts employees: Dan Connors, CEO and former producer/director at LucasArts; Kevin Bruner, Chief Technology Officer who helped develop the engines for many prominent LucasArts titles; and Troy Molander, former director of the LucasArts Technical Art Department. The studio developed games based on existing intellectual properties except for their first game. The core focus was adventure games, initially only for the PC, but later also for the Xbox 360 and the Wii. The first release was the casual poker game Telltale Texas Hold'em (2005). Next, they created the two episodes in the Bone series, adapted from Jeff Smith's comics: Bone: Out from Boneville (2005) and Bone: The Great Cow Race (2006). Both games were made available as digital downloads and physical copies. Although more episodes were originally planned, no new ones were eventually released. Through the learning process Telltale also updated the second episode's interface and engine, and released an updated version for the first episode. In between, they did the 4th and 5th CSI game: 3 Dimensions of Murder (Windows - 2006, PS2 - 2007) and Hard Evidence (Windows, Xbox 360 - 2007). Telltale also took on an advisory role for Ankh (2006). Between October 2006 and April 2007 the company released Sam & Max: Season One, a series of episodic games based on Steve Purcell's Sam & Max comics. Season 1 consists of six games and part of the development was funded by digital content distributor GameTap, granting the company to offer the episodes through its website prior to a global release (usually for about two weeks). In November 2007 a second season of five episodes was started. It ran until April 2008. Both series can also be ordered as a physical copy directly from the site and there was a retail release of the seasons in selected regions. Before the last episode was released, the company announced a new series of five games, Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, based on the online Homestar Runner body of work. The first episode, Homestar Ruiner, was released in August 2008. Next to the PC version, it was also the company's first Wii game and was offered through Nintendo's WiiWare service. In March 2009 the studio released the first episode in a new series: Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures, based on the characters from a series of British animated short films. On 1st June 2009, yet another series was announced: Tales of Monkey Island, based on the long-running Monkey Island series from LucasArts. Having become an icon of the adventure scene, Telltale also sold digital download versions of other adventures through their online shop. The company was known for releasing its games in different episodes, a practice CEO Dan Connors referred to as ""license incubation"" to build up and tweak a franchise step by step. Telltale was shut down in 2018 after filing for bankruptcy; its brand ended up acquired by LCG Entertainment, Inc.. Some titles have been since then reissued by the new Telltale, such as The Wolf Among Us and Puzzle Agent. Others became the property of separate entities, such as Skunkape for Sam & Max and Skybound for The Walking Dead.

"Digital Extremes, Inc.","London, Ontario-based Digital Extremes was founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, who previously worked at Epic MegaGames on Solar Winds. Digital Extremes' first game was Epic Pinball, published as shareware by Epic MegaGames. Epic Pinball proved to be a huge success in the shareware market, warranting two spin-offs by Digital Extremes. Silverball, released later in 1993, was a commercial version of Epic Pinball with all-new tables. Extreme Pinball, released in 1995, was an all-new pinball game with new features and a faster game engine. All three of these games helped fund the development of Unreal, which started development in 1994 at Digital Extremes. Unreal was a first-person shooter that sported a true 3-D graphics engine, and spent four years in development limbo before it was finally released in 1998. Unreal also proved to be a huge success in the gaming industry. The first three Unreal Tournament games and Unreal Championship were developed by Digital Extremes, but Epic MegaGames (who co-developed all of the Unreal games) has owned the rights to the Unreal franchise ever since. Digital Extremes has moved away from the Unreal franchise to work on Dark Sector, a third-person stealth shooter released in 2008. In 2001, Digital Extremes formed a second studio in Toronto, Ontario to focus on developing console games.

Nival finances and publishes external developers including KranX Productions, creators of King's Bounty: Legions and Bytex, developers of Berserk Online. In early 2005, the part of Nival operating under the name Nival Interactive was bought by Ener1 Group, a Florida-based holdings company, for around US$10 million. The development teams remained in Moscow, but marketing, management and creative teams to aid in development were moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US). One month later, the company acquired development studio Targem Games. On November 30, 2007, Sergey Orlovskiy regained full control of Nival Interactive. In early 2010, another part of Nival, Astrum Nival, was bought by the largest Russian portal Mail.Ru for more than $100 million, becoming a part of Astrum Online Entertainment. Currently Nival’s internal development studios are focused on PC and mobile projects. In 2011, Nival Interactive was merged with Nival Network into a new company, called Nival. Nival has developed and launched Prime World and King's Bounty: Legions, and has several projects in development.  In December 2013, Nival raised $6 million in its Series A funding round led by Almaz Capital.

ASCII Corporation,"ASCII Corporation was a Japanese company founded by Kazuhiko Nishi on May 24th, 1977. Its early cooperation with Microsoft led to the creation of the MSX home computer systems architecture, an eventual de facto for the Japanese market. It later became a subsidiary of the Kadokawa Corporation and focused on the publication of print magazines dealing with computers and hardware. In its early years ASCII focused on the development of said hardware and software for it but later, when the video game market got rough in the mid-eighties, the company started to develop and publish software for popular gaming consoles of that time, namely the Nintendo Entertainment System and the SEGA Genesis. Due to their success in the market, ASCII decided to establish an U.S. subsidiary in 1991 which became known as ASCII Entertainment. In the following years the Japanese market of ASCII declined slowly while the US market became profitable and so another subsidiary was founded in 1998. It became known as 'Ascii Game Entertainment TEChnology', Agetec for short. Agetec's primary field of business was the publication of video games. In 1999 Agetec was spun off and became a fully independent publisher of games though business relationships remained. In March 2002, ASCII Corporation finally ceased to distribute and publish video games on the Japanese market and started to center its attention around its early core competencies, IT- and computer-magazines like the prestigious ASCII-magazine. The software development branch was subsequently spun off as Media Leaves Inc. After two more years, in January 2004, ASCII, as well as its spin offs, Media Leaves Inc. and Enterbrain Inc, were bought by the Kadokawa Holdings which established itself as the prime distributor of game-media-coverage in Japan by doing so. On April 1st, 2008 ASCII Corporation and MediaWorks, Inc. merged to form the company ASCII Media Works, Inc. and MediaWorks was legally absorbed by ASCII. On October 1st, 2013 Kadokawa Corporation turned the company into an internal division.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/2652952c-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1982,2002,Japan

Blizzard Entertainment Inc.,"Blizzard Entertainment Inc. was founded as Silicon & Synapse in 1991 in Irvine, California by Allen Adham and Michael Morhaime, with Brian Fargo, the CEO and founder of Interplay Entertainment, being granted a share in the company to improve the prospects of working jointly for the young studio. Frank Pearce also joined upon inception as the first employee. The small company initially did many ports, converting games from one platform operating system to another, including board games (Battle Chess, Lexicross), strategy games (Castles), sports games (MicroLeague Baseball), and educational games (Dvorak on Typing). However, they were the first American developer to release a Super Nintendo title with RPM Racing, which became one of the first ten launch titles for the platform in North America. It was not until Silicon & Synapse collaborated with Interplay Entertainment on the SNES side-scroller The Lost Vikings that the company had its critical – though not commercial – breakthrough. With some acclaim, the game hit the shelves in 1993. Its release, along with Rock n' Roll Racing (also 1993) led Nintendo to name the studio its ""Developer of the Year"". Tragically, the release of the two games coincided with the death of the 16-bit console market, and neither title sold well. Facing a lack of success in the console market, and not willing to bet solely on one market, the company continued developing several 16-bit console titles while branching out by starting development on two new games: Games People Play, a crossword/word game that was never completed, and WarCraft: Orcs & Humans. Blackthorne was released under the new name Chaos Studios, but conflicts with an unregistered trademark for ""Chaos"" forced the company leadership to again consider a new name. In February 1994, upon acquisition by Davidson & Associates, one of the largest educational software publishers, it was changed to Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard became an influential development studio thanks to well-received franchises such as WarCraft, Diablo and StarCraft. The studio garnered many awards and a great deal of commercial success; building one of the most profitable games ever with the release of World of WarCraft in 2004. A good deal of the success for the company's online games can be attributed to Battle.net, a free online gaming service on the Internet. In the 2000s and 2010s, Battle.net was crucial in establishing Blizzard's esports dominance with titles like StarCraft: Brood War, StarCraft II, Hearthstone and Overwatch. In their strategy titles, the official map editors helped create a strong modding community, resulting in the spawning of the MOBA genre originally as maps for WarCraft III: The Frozen Throne, and later as standalone titles without Blizzard's involvement or dependency on their games. Blizzard themselves were slow to react to the trend, releasing their own MOBA title Heroes of the Storm in 2015. Blizzard's successful streak would end in the mid-2010s, with key figures from the company started leaving in large numbers, usually to newly-founded companies of their own. Public perception of the company would shift more negatively due to a larger focus on mobile games (e.g. the infamous announcement of Diablo: Immortal at BlizzCon 2018), botched game reworks (WarCraft III: Reforged and Overwatch 2), focusing on the Chinese market until the split with NetEase in 2023 (eventually resolved in 2024), and an ongoing major lawsuit in California filed in 2021 by current and former employees claiming that discrimination and sexual misconduct is present in the company culture. The company's ownership has shifted many times over the years, through mergers, name changes or acquisitions:  Davidson & Associates (1994-1996) CUC Software International (1996-1997) Cendant Software (1997-1998) Havas Interactive (1998-1999) Vivendi (1999-2008) Activision Blizzard (2008-present)  In its history, the company also had many titles in development that were eventually canceled. These include:  Games People Play: an early 1990s title featuring crossword puzzles, boggle, and other word games. Denizen: an action RPG for SunSoft. Its development was started twice, once in the early years, and once after WarCraft: Orcs & Humans was released. Blizzard had a working SNES prototype but never got funding, so the game was shelved. Crixa: a 2D top-down spaceship shooter taking inspiration from Star Maze. It was originally designed as an in-house test at Qualia Games in 1995. However, after a month, Qualia's funding crashed. They got a publishing deal with Blizzard, who canceled the game in 1996. Shattered Nations: a post-apocalyptic, turn-based strategy game with an isometric perspective. The game was announced at E3 1995 and canceled in 1996. Pax Imperia 2: the sequel to Pax Imperia. Its development started as a collaboration between Blizzard and Changeling Software. Announced during CES 1995, it was planned for a Christmas 1995 release on Mac and Windows. By August 1996, Blizzard had sold the rights to THQ, for who Changeling, in the meantime renamed to Heliotrope Studios, finished the game as Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain. WarCraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans: a point and click adventure game set in the WarCraft universe. It was announced in March 1997, but because it failed Blizzard's quality standards the game's cancellation was reported on 22 May 1998. A near-finished build leaked online in September 2016. Raiko: an action RPG like Diablo with a 3D engine set in ancient Japan. It was being developed by Flextech between 1996 and 1998. Nomad: the precursor to World of WarCraft. It was canceled in 1999 when development on the latter began. StarCraft: Ghost: a stealth-action behind-view shooter, set in the StarCraft universe. The GameCube's version cancellation was reported in November 2005. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox were postponed indefinitely in March 2006 and confirmed canceled in 2014. A build of the Xbox version leaked online in February 2020. Titan: a massively multiplayer game officially canceled in September 2014 after seven years of development. Many concepts and assets were repurposed for the multiplayer shooter Overwatch.

Eutechnyx was incorporated as Zeppelin Games Limited, in November 1987 and during the period to 1990 it produced over 250 titles, which included several major TV and sports personality licences.  During the early 1990s, Zeppelin Games began undertaking development contracts for the new SEGA and Nintendo consoles, for publishers such as Codemasters. During 1994, the company was wholly acquired by Merit Studios, Inc., an American public company based in Dallas, Texas. Zeppelin Games then became Merit Studios (Europe) Limited and the company was allocated responsibility for the sales, marketing and distribution of Merit Inc.'s US games into the European marketplace, as well as developing its own products.  This was a period of sustained growth for the company and as a result its internal development team was strengthened and expanded along with major capital expenditure on Silicon Graphics and similarly powerful hardware, to produce more sophisticated games for the new interactive PC CD ROM media and the new emerging consoles.  In 1996, Merit Studios (Europe) Limited obtained both registered developer and publisher status for Sony PlayStation. At the end of 1996, the directors of Merit Studios (Europe) completed a Management Buy Back of the European Subsidiary from Merit Studios, Inc. The company was renamed Eutechnyx Limited, with the Infogrames Group acquiring a minority shareholding in the company. Eutechnyx then entered into an exclusive 3-year agreement with Infogrames, developing products on Sony PlayStation and PC CD ROM. The exclusive distribution agreement with Infogrames ended in December 1999, after which time the directors of Eutechnyx reacquired total control of the shareholding of the company.

Game development for console platforms began in about 1999. The company was acquired by Activision in January 2005 and operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Vicarious Visions had a development studio located in Mountain View, California, which primarily developed handheld games. This studio employed about 25 people and was closed by Activision in June 2007. For Activision, Vicarious Visions worked on many licensed games such as Shrek, Spider-Man and Kung Fu Panda. The studio also created titles in the Guitar Hero series, such as Guitar Hero: On Tour and the Wii version of Band Hero. In February 2011, Activision decided not to develop any more Guitar Hero or Tony Hawk games. According to the website Develop, the studio was working on a new Guitar Hero at the time. Develop's source states that closure was averted, but about 50 people were laid off, about a quarter of the workforce. Later that month, the new studio Play Eternal was announced, with former VV members such as Albert Vazquez and Brandon Van Slyk. On 21 January 2021, it was announced the studio of 200 employees was moved from Activision to the Blizzard side of the parent company, merging the team entirely into Blizzard Entertainment.

Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,"Sculptured Software was a game development company based in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA) and founded in 1984 by George Metos, Peter Adams, and Bryan Brandenburg. George Metos incorporated the company on July 12, 1985 in the state of Utah with the help of some investors, as Sculptured Software, Inc. The company was an early pioneer in the video gaming industry, porting many games from arcade to home console systems, and developing its own games as well. Two of Sculptured Software's first in-house games were Ninja and Street Surfer. Sculptured Software stayed very busy and successful, with over 50 games to its credit, so it is of no surprise that the company became a target for acquisition by larger companies. This happened in October 1995 when Acclaim bought the company. Acclaim had also purchased Probe Entertainment as well as Iguana Entertainment several months earlier, and the three companies were collectively known as ""Acclaim Studios"" in 1998, although no official name changing happened until later. It appears that the Sculptured Studios, Inc. name remained since it was printed on game packaging all the way through 1999. It was referred to as ""Iguana West"", but it is unsure whether this name was officially used as a development entity. Restructuring and rearranging things within Acclaim occurred in an attempt to streamline operations, and the Sculptured Software name was discontinued in favor of Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City in about July 1999. The first game we have on record developed by Acclaim Studios SLC was ECW Hardcore Revolution (31 January 2000), and the last completed game by the studio was Legends of Wrestling II (2002). Acclaim Studios SLC was working on Showdown: Legends of Wrestling and one other unannounced game when the headquarters decided to close the studio in December 2002.

In 1995, Sonic Team was officially established as a division within Sega, known internally as Sega CS3 R&D Division. The studio was headed up by Yuji Naka, with Naoto Ohshima and Takashi Iizuka directly below. The studio was renamed to Sega R&D 8 in 1998 after the AM/CS distinction was abandoned, and in 2000, R&D8 was spun off as an independent studio, at last being officially known as Sonic Team.

"PopCap Games, Inc.","The PopCap story begins in the snowy wastes of northern Alberta, Canada, where Jason Kapalka grew to manhood, fighting polar bears and wild moose for survival. He would amuse friends and family around the tribal campfire with tall tales and simple games, such as ""Pin the Tail on the Muskrat."" When Silicon Valley called, it was with a heavy heart that Jason left the tundra for sunnier climes… but he knew that the Americans hungered for the gaming wisdom of the far North.  While Jason joined TEN, the Total Entertainment Network (which would later become Pogo.com), the other core members of PopCap were experiencing their own rites of passage in the tornado-blasted trailer-parks of Indiana, where John Vechey and Brian Fiete first met during an out-of-control 'kegger' party. Finding kindred spirits, they soon turned their attention away from the bleak landscape of rusted-out cars that surrounded them, to the fairy-dust world of online gaming, where their elfin spirits could find solace and inspiration.  The result was Hoopy Entertainment and ARC (Attack/Retrieve/Capture), one of the first online-only action games, which caught the eye of Jason, now a producer at TEN. After brutal manipulative 'negotiations,' TEN acquired the rights to ARC, and Jason was assigned to help whip it into shape. Finding in the mulleted Hoopys a spark of talent and inspiration, he fanned this flame as ARC was launched on TEN.  Sadly, as TEN's business model changed every three months or so, ARC was soon swept by the roadside as family java games became the priority. Jason moved on to Bingo and Backgammon, while the Hoopys sold out to Won.net, moving to Seattle, where they were forced to cut their mullets and drink from glasses.  Years passed as they all toiled in their separate tasks, but they had never forgotten the almost-mystical link that had been forged. And so, one fateful day in 2000, a dark pact was formed, and the three sealed in blood their commitment to build mass-market online Java games playable right from a browser. And so PopCap came to be. The company has enjoyed much success since its founding, stemming from the popularity of many of its casual games such as the Bejeweled and Plants vs. Zombies franchises and became known throughout the gaming world. This success led gaming juggernaut Electronic Arts to buy the company for $750 million on 12 July 2011, an acquisition that could become the biggest of its many to date if all payouts in the deal are made.

Criterion Software Ltd.,"Criterion is a game development company founded on 29 January 1990 and based in Guildford, England (UK). The team is especially known for the fast-paced Burnout series of race games and its proprietary 3D engine RenderWare. The company had offices in the United States (Austin, Texas - Criterion Software Inc.), Derby (UK), Paris (France) and Tokyo (Japan). It was owned by Canon Europe N.V. One of Criterion's subsidiaries was Fiendish Games (closed in late 2000). In 2004, Criterion was sold by Canon to Electronic Arts UK Limited and became an internal development studio of Electronic Arts. In the summer of 2006, the Derby satellite office was closed. In February or March 2007, Electronic Arts UK combined its Chertsey-based UK development studio and Criterion Games into a new building in central Guildford (UK), creating a single studio together with the now-closed EA Bright Light, part of EA Casual Entertainment.  In September 2013, it was revealed the main Criterion team had been downsized to 16 people, known as Criterion Zero. The other part, about 60-65 people, was dubbed Ghost Games UK as a support studio for the Swedish EA studio Ghost Games. In February 2014 it was reported all of the contractors at Ghost Games UK were let go and the full staff were said to either take redundancy or join the team at Criterion to work on Battlefield: Hardline. On 12 May 2022, it was announced that Codemasters Cheshire would be absorbed into Criterion Software. Criterion is currently still active with the name Criterion Software Ltd., the company name that was registered on 29 November 2001. The other registered companies tied to Criterion were all dissolved on 13 May 2014: Criterion Software Group Ltd. (registered on 29 January 1990), Criterion Software International Ltd. (registered on 29 January 1990) and Electronic Arts (UK) Ltd. (registered on 15 July 2004). Although informally referenced as EA UK in the Battlefield Hardline credits, Criterion Software Ltd. is most like the only active studio name.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/f244a462-e2f2-11ef-abe5-02420a000162.webp,1994,2025,United States

"Dinamic Multimedia, S.A.","Dinamic Software, originally founded as Microdigital Soft, was a Spanish game development and publishing company that existed more than 15 years on games for a wide variety of platforms. It was founded in 1986 by three brothers: Ignacio Ruiz Tejedor, Víctor Ruiz Tejedor and Pablo Ruiz Tejedor. Despite the original founding name, the company quickly adapted to Dinamic as the founders had already been publishing games since 1984 prior to the establishment, using that name. Some games from that period are Babaliba (1984), Mapsnatch (1984), Saimazoom (1984), Video Olympics (1984), Yenght (1984), the boxing game Rocco (1985) and the platform title Abu Simbel Profanation (1985). The latter two were licensed in the UK by Gremlin Graphics. One of their first breakthrough titles was West Bank (1985). Other titles from that year were Phantomas (1986) and Vampire (working together with Codemasters), as well as Camelot Warriors (1985). Early on the games were made in Boadilla del Monte, later the business was expanded and relocated to the ""Torre de Madrid"". In 1987 they worked together with Ocean/Imagine on such titles as Army Moves (1986), Game Over (1987) and Freddy Hardest (1987). Their most successful title then was Basket Master (1987). It sold 900,000 units in Spain and became the best-selling game of all times in the country. The amount of sales was however soon surpassed by Topo Soft's Emilio Butragueño Fútbol. When the deal with Ocean expired, Dinamic signed with Electronic Arts, Inc. The first title released for the company was Game Over II (1987), followed by another sequel: Navy Moves (1988), Aspar GP Master (1988) and After the War (1989). In 1990 the company was hit by a Spanish software crisis and would start to distribute fewer games. The last title to be released by the company was Narco Police. Before that, the in-house development teams had already shrunk and most of the Dinamic games were developed by other software teams such as Zeus Software, Iron Byte and Creepsoft. From then on, the company focused exclusively on 16-bit games, with titles as Risky Woods. In 1992 the old Dinamic company disappeared and with the help of Hobby Press it was relaunched as Dinamic Multimedia, S.A.. From then on the successful PC Fútbol and PC Basket series were launched, even revisiting an older franchise through Arctic Moves (1995), and the company also published many games by other Spanish game development studios. Some failures however led to the downfall of the company. One of the most important factors was the lack of success of its MMORPG La Prisión (2000). On 24th September 2001 it was announced the company had been closed. At that time it employed 55 people.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/c032aacc-bc76-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1984,2002,Spain

Rare Limited,"Rare Limited was formed in England in 1985 shortly before the Stamper brothers sold off Ultimate Play the Game. Rare took over the development activities for the NES. Rare Coin-it, a sister company, was formed in Miami under separate directorship, but Rare only produced four coin-ops (only one of which it published itself). They produced a large number of NES games including RC Pro-Am and the Battletoads franchise (possibly based on the then-topical success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). During the NES days Rare became allied with Zippo Games, later buying that company from Steve and John Pickford and renaming it Rare Manchester. During this period Rare developed many licenses, and also programmed conversions.  In 1993/4 Rare risked the expense of a great deal of silicon graphics technology. This resulted in the creation of the Donkey Kong Country series for the SNES. Killer Instinct for the arcades (published by Midway, with subsequent console conversions published by Nintendo) used the same technology with similarly successful results. The creation of Donkey Kong Country, apart from making Rare rich (it was released after the release of the SEGA Saturn, toward the end of the SNES' lifetime, resulting in it being the only obvious product for SNES owners to buy that Christmas), sealed Rare's relationship with Nintendo. Nintendo had bought 25% of Rare shares in 1995, meaning that Rare became a Nintendo second party developer. This relationship flourished after the release of the N64, which Rare supported with a string of high selling games. GoldenEye 007 sold around five million copies worldwide. Starting in 1997, rare began to self-publish game under the 1995 founded Rareware Limited. In September 2002, Rare was bought by Microsoft for an alleged $375 million and they were tasked to develop two launch titles for the new Xbox 360 console that was released in November 2005: Kameo: Elements of Power and Perfect Dark Zero. Although fairly well received, they didn't match the success of Rare's earlier system sellers. In the first three years after the Microsoft acquisition Rare also created titles for THQ such as Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge and Banjo Pilot (2005) in the Banjo-Kazooie series, as well as Sabre Wulf (2004) and It's Mr Pants (2004). Rare also made two titles for Microsoft for the original Xbox: Grabbed by the Ghoulies (2003) and Conker: Live & Reloaded (2005). In January 2007, it was announced that co-founders Chris and Tim Stamper were leaving the company that they once founded to pursue other opportunities. After the Xbox 360 launch titles Rare was almost uniquely focused on the Viva Piñata franchise for Microsoft. Other projects were Diddy Kong Racing DS (2007) returning to an original franchise, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts (2008) as another entry in a long-running series, and the XBLA game Jetpac Refuelled (2007). As one of Microsoft's cornerstone developers Rare created Kinect Sports for the launch of Xbox 360 Kinect peripheral in November 2010, as the equivalent of Wii Sports for the Nintendo Wii launch, even though Kinect Sports was not bundled with the device. After developing several Kinect Sports sequels and the Rare Replay compilation of their classic games ported to the Xbox One, they closed off the 2010s with Sea of Thieves. Their title Everwild was announced in November 2019, but was restarted in 2021, and ultimately cancelled on 2 July 2025.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/c3306198-bc7f-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1986,2024,

3D Realms Entertainment ApS,"In 1994, Apogee Software, Ltd. created a new division, 3D Realms Entertainment, with the goal of developing 3D action games.  3D Realms' first title, Terminal Velocity (1995), developed by Dallas-area developer Terminal Reality, was an arcade-style, fast-paced fully 3D futuristic flight combat game. This was the first shareware game to get on the cover of a major gaming magazine (the now-defunct Computer Game Player). Next came Duke Nukem 3D (1996), the first 3D installment in the series.  Financially, 3D Realms was able to self-fund internal development of entire projects. In fact, 3D Realms has never had a game budget or used a spreadsheet for budget planning - they only had expense tracking. Originally, Action Entertainment's 3D games were going to be published under the Apogee name. However, in late August of 1994, 3D Realms was born, and the four next-generation 3D games that Action had under production - Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Blood (eventually published by GT Interactive) and Ruins: Return of the Gods (later cancelled), all of which used the Build engine - moved under the 3D Realms label. After their successes in the 1990s, the company would produce titles developed by other companies, most notably the first two Max Payne titles and Prey (2006). Meanwhile, they were developing Duke Nukem Forever in-house, the process of which became infamously long and troubled. On 6 May 2009, amid financial difficulties, the company laid off its development team. In September 2010, Gearbox Software picked up the development of Duke Nukem Forever and published it on 9 June 2011, with the development cycle totaling at an unprecedented 15 years. The Duke Nukem IP would also eventually be sold to Gearbox Software. On 3 March 2014, the company was acquired by the Danish investment firm SDN Invest, and became the publishing-oriented sister company to Interceptor Entertainment (today Slipgate Ironworks) and moved to Aalborg, Denmark. The CEO position was taken by Frederik Schreiber, while Scott Miller was initially an advisor before fully moving to the relaunched Apogee Entertainment by 2021. While 3D Realms has since focused on internally developed games, it would (co-)publish third-party AA and indie projects, such as Cultic and Ripout. Since the success of Ion Fury, the company started the annual event Realms Deep, where it would not only showcase in-development projects, but focus on spotlighting independent productions by smaller teams and the community of the so-called ""boomer shooter"" games. On 5 August 2021, the company was acquired by Saber Interactive, which was then a subsidiary of the Embracer Group. When Saber Interactive split from Embracer on 14 March 2024, 3D Realms and Slipgate Ironworks were part of Saber's portfolio that moved alongside them. The company's first strategy title, Tempest Rising, was released in 2025.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/49a0fc52-5fdb-11ee-a670-02420a0001d8.webp,1995,2025,Denmark

EA Digital Illusions CE AB,"Started in 1988 by Ulf Mandorff, Olof Gustafsson, Fredrik Liliegren and Andreas Axelsson, EA Digital Illusions CE AB is a Swedish game development studio. Like many Scandinavian studios, it was originally started as a demo group, The Silents. The four initial developers all came from the same town Alvesta in Sweden. During the initial days the team also operated out of a dorm room at Växjö University. Initially, the company was well known for its Amiga and DOS pinball games, such as Pinball Dreams (1992) and Pinball Illusions (1995). The company was officially formed as Digital Illusions HB in May 1992 and became Digital Illusions CE AB in January 1993. The company moved to Gothenburg in 1994 and remained there until 2005. A big expansion occurred in early 2000 when the company fully acquired Refraction Games AB and a large majority of Synergenix Interactive AB, though the latter was bought by RedJade Inc. in the same year. Also in 2000, subsidiary DICE Simulations AB was started to work on interactive simulations. It was liquidated in 2010. In 2001, DICE made its presence in North America through the acquisition of the assets of the Canadian development studio Sandbox Studios. It was renamed Digital Illusions Canada, Inc. The company's breakthrough occurred at the end of 2002 with the release of warfare shooter Battlefield 1942, the first game in a long-running series of Battlefield games. In March 2003 Electronic Arts, which published the first game, became the studio's biggest owner with 19 percent of the stocks. The team to work on the franchise was strengthened with the acquisition of Trauma Studios in September 2004, a studio that became known through the popular Desert Combat mod for BF1942. The Trauma studio was then dubbed DICE New York. After doing work on Battlefield 2 (2005), the Swedish studio wanted the US team to move to Sweden to help work on Battlefield 2142 (2006), but Trauma decided against relocation and was discontinued in June 2005. Most of that team moved on as Kaos Studios working for THQ. In November 2004 Electronic Arts announced its intent to buy all outstanding shares of the company. The offer was accepted, and on 31 March 2005, EA owned 62% of the company. The acquisition was completed on 2 October 2006 and the studio was renamed EA Digital Illusions CE AB. Digital Illusions Canada was closed shortly thereafter, however. For most of the titles, the company used two generations of the Refractor engine, originally by Refraction Games AB. In June 2008, with the release of Battlefield: Bad Company, an entirely new in-house developed engine was introduced: Frostbite DX. After having worked almost exclusively on the Battlefield warfare franchise since 2002, an entirely new game was introduced in November 2008, the parkour action game Mirror's Edge, based on a completely new IP. Besides short detours with Medal of Honor (2010) and Mirror's Edge: Catalyst in 2016, DICE would be tasked with three things throughout its time under EA: developing further Battlefield titles, co-developing the rebooted Star Wars: Battlefront series, and iterating on the Frostbite engine for both their own titles and games by other EA subsidiaries. From 15 May 2013 to 7 July 2021, DICE had an auxiliary studio in Los Angeles, DICE LA, formerly Danger Close. After the release of Battlefield 2042, its operations were separated from DICE. Engines developed  Refractor 2 (with Refraction Games) Frostbite DX Frostbite 2 Frostbite 3",https://cdn.mobygames.com/03750e02-68a4-11f0-b45f-02420a00011e.webp,1992,2025,Sweden

"Bally Data Systems, Inc.","Midway Mfg. Co. was incorporated in 1969 when Midway Manufacturing Co. was acquired by Bally Manufacturing Corporation. Midway continued their business as manufacturer of electro-mechanical arcade machines, but starting in 1973 their main business became videogame arcade games.  The Midway team designed a video game console and simple computer which was released under the Bally name in 1978 - the Bally Professional Arcade (eventually renamed Bally Computer System and then Bally Astrocade). Using a custom video display chip, this 8-bit console had 4k of RAM, a keyboard, and used cassette-sized cartridges known as Videocades. Users could also do minimal programming with the BASIC program included. About 45 games were released for this console. In 1982 Bally merged its pinball division with Midway forming Bally Midway Mfg. Co. That same year an important acquisition took place when Bally Midway purchased the American coin-operated assets of Sega Enterprises. In 1988, Williams Electronic Games purchased Bally Midway Mfg. Co. for $8 million. The Bally portion was merged into Williams' existing pinball divisions and Midway was incorporated as a separate entity. A few years later, Williams bought the Bally name for exclusive use on its pinball machines. The Bally Midway Mfg. Co. name was still used on game covers until 1990. It appears that, although Midway probably had a hand in the development of those games, they were based on arcade games developed cooperatively by the two companies when they were one entity and licensed by them. The exact business of Bally Data Systems Inc., the name of the company after 1988, is not known.

Maxis Software Inc.,"Maxis Software Inc. is a game development studio founded by Will Wright and Jeff Braun in 1987 in California (USA). The company was best known for its best-selling series of Sim games. Coined with SimCity in 1989, these games all use the Sim prefix and are mostly managerial strategy games, spanning all kinds of areas. The most successful segment is The Sims franchise. The company also had two other divisions, Maxis UK and Maxis South. Prior to starting The Sims, the company was acquired by Electronic Arts in June 1997. The integration went slowly. The original studio location based in Walnut Creek officially closed in February 2004 and most of the jobs were moved to EA Redwood City. Although the studio was officially closed, the name Maxis still remained associated with The Sims games and most games are thus still credited as such. During the years, EA steadily removed Maxis from in-game text and credits and the development was credited to The Sims Studio based on the Electronic Arts’ Redwood City campus. Called Maxis and later EA Maxis, the name became one of EA's four primary labels, replacing the EA Play brand in 2012. Maxis was reintegrated with The Sims Studio in 2012 and Maxis returned as a branding development name in 2013, also with staff from EA Salt Lake, and tracktwenty (formerly EA Helsinki) for mobile development. The original founder Will Wright is considered one of the industry's visionaries. When The Sims production was moved into EA, he continued to operate a studio in Emeryville (known as Electronic Arts Emeryville and later Maxis Emeryville), California where he developed the Spore franchise. This studio was largely considered the successor to the original Maxis studio. The Maxis Emeryville studio was closed around March 2015. In 2023, Maxis was composed of three offices:  Redwood City, California Austin, Texas Kitchener, Ontario",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d3953a38-bd09-11ed-9703-02420a00018f.webp,1988,2024,United States

Over the years, AM2 has practically defined the arcade experience with titles such as Hang-On, Space Harrier, Afterburner, Virtua Fighter, and Daytona USA. In fact, AM2 is such a strong name in the industry that when Sega's AM Departments were spun-off and renamed, AM2 kept their name. Formed in 1983, AM2 employs about 200 people at their offices in Tokyo's Shibuya district.  One can't tell the story of AM2 without talking about Yu Suzuki. AM2's star developer is one of the most highly-regarded visionaries in the industry. He joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer and producer, and two years later he created Hang-On, the first simulation arcade game. Hang-On was also the first arcade racing game to feature a fully interactive cabinet, with the player sitting on and controlling a replica motorcycle.  While Suzuki's games are the most prominent, they are not the only games AM2 has produced. The group has rocked arcades with titles like Daytona USA, Virtua Cop, Virtua Striker, and Fighting Vipers. AM2 is also responsible for Dreamcast versions of their arcade hits Outtrigger and Wheeler American Pro Trucker.

Hewson Consultants Ltd.,"The Hewson Express (Sinclair User, October 1985) The unstoppable Hewson Consultants has been steaming ahead for half a decade. Chris Bourne talks to the man on the footplate.  FIVE YEARS is a long, long time in this business. Five years ago, the ZX-80 was hailed as a breakthrough at under £100. Five years ago, people were building Nascom computers from kits, and computer magazines, such as there were, printed listings of Othello for the UK101 or Acorn Atom. The prince of machines was the Commodore PET. There were no Amstrads. No Orics. No VIC 20s, BBCs, MSXs, C64s, Spectrums or QLs. And there were no games. Computers were not supposed to be about playing games, bought off the shelf. They were about writing your own, because it was an interesting way of learning how to program. It was all very earnest, the obsessive hobby of a tiny minority. And one of the few, the very few, software companies to have started back then, and still going today is Hewson Consultants, now celebrating its fifth birthday.  Andrew Hewson is well known to readers of Sinclair User through his Helpline column, which has been informing, and occasionally baffling, folks with revelations about machine code ever since the magazine began. But he's also the founder, and managing director, of Hewson Consultants, set up on a shoestring in 1980, and now an expanding business infiltrating the charts with programs such as Dragontorc and Southern Belle.  Andrew's a chemical physicist by education - he did a degree at Sussex University. In 1972 he started working at the British Museum assessing the age of objects by radiocarbon dating.  ""In 1973 the Museum got a computer,"" says Andrew. ""It was a big step forward. Businesses used computers for things like insurance, and doing gas bills and so on. But in the last ten years or so it's made an enormous difference to science."" The museum was one of the first organisations outside the big universities to acquire a computer for research work, rather than as a filing or accounting system.  Since nobody at the Museum could program it, an expert was brought in to run it, and Andrew learned how to program from him. ""I learned good habits,"" says Andrew. ""You have to take it slowly when you program. It was a 16-bit Hewlett Packard with a 64K memory. The memory was a set of ferrite rings which lived in a drawer. We had a couple of tape drives, a disc drive and a printer, and the operating system had to work frantically to keep it all going.""  After seven years at the Brit, Andrew joined NERC, one of those much-derided quangoes. He moved to Oxfordshire and is still there.  ""I'd been up to Manchester with my boss, and on the way home we stopped off at the Wimpy in Stratford-upon-Avon for a cuppa. He started talking about the ZX-80 and how wonderful it was."" Andrew was not impressed. ""I said, ""you must be joking!"" and started listing all the reasons why the machine was awful. He said, ""look at the price"". And the penny dropped.""  Andrew leans back, puts his hands behind his head, and explains how, if you wanted a system with any equipment - printers, discs or whatever - you needed about £2,000. ""So I bought a ZX-80 and played around with it. You only get one life.""  Right from the start it was business. Andrew was interested in making money, not acquiring a hobby. ""I had a wife and two kids and a mortgage."" He taps his head. ""If I'm as clever as I think I am - no, that's not right. If you think ""I can do this"", then there's an easy way to prove it.""  What also made Andrew keen to set up his own business was an increasing dislike of the sort of organisation he was working for. ""I learned that in fixed institutions, the job was never going to be more than it already was. Those places don't care if you spend ten years on some obscure project if it produces 'knowledge'. I got fed up with it.""  Andrew's one of those people who are concerned to analyse carefully what they do. ""What isn't apparent to the public is the effect of government cutbacks and what it generates in the civil service. Look at the teachers - they're desperately anxious about the future of their profession. It was the same in government science departments. ""It's always difficult to look back on your own motives"" he adds, cautiously.  So, Andrew hummed and hawed a bit and then got down to uncovering the innards of the ZX-80. ""It was a breath of fresh air, the first computer I'd ever worked with where you could get at all of it. Usually you are given the ground rules - operating system, language and so on."" What he means is the way you can inspect the ROM of Sinclair machines easily, and write directly in machine code.  Andrew's first move was logical. All his moves are logical. Having discovered the ROM he wrote a book, Hints and Tips for the ZX-80. ""People were interested in books. That book was why I'm now doing the Sinclair User column. It's about things like clearing a part of the display, or how variables are stored.""  Hewson Consultants was thus formed on a mere £500 of capital.a, ST) - Hewson, 1988  - Marauder (Spectrum, C64) - Hewson, 1988  - Nebulus (Spectrum, C64, Amstrad, Amiga, ST) - Hewson, 1988  - Netherworld (Spectrum, C64, Amstrad, Amiga, ST) - Hewson, 1988  - Stormlord (Spectrum, C64, Amstrad, Amiga, ST) - Hewson, 1988  - Astoreth (Amiga, ST) - Hewson, 1989  Deliverance: Stormlord 2 (Spectrum, C64, Amstrad) - Hewson, 1989  In 1991 Hewson Consultants was wound up and replaced by 21st Century Entertainment Ltd, which is still trading!

The following year, in 1998, the company acquired two development studios: BlueSky Software and Digital Integration Ltd. The year after, following the majority investment in US games publisher Interplay who in February 1999 acquired 43.9% of Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Titus agreed to acquire an additional 50.1% of the publisher and distributor Virgin Interactive Entertainment.

Ubisoft Düsseldorf,"Ubisoft Düsseldorf, originally Blue Byte Software, is a game developer based in Düsseldorf, Germany. The company was founded in October 1988 in Mülheim by Thomas Hertzler and Lothar Schmitt, both former employees of Rainbow Arts. Blue Byte debuted with Pro Tennis Tour / Great Courts, before moving towards the Battle Isle and The Settlers strategy games for which they were most famed. Their original focus was the Amiga until 1994, when they switched their focus towards the PC. Blue Byte opened several divisions for publishing, distribution and additional development:  Blue Byte Software, Inc. - United States Blue Byte Software Ltd. - United Kingdom  The company's fortunes wavered in the late 1990s, and they were absorbed by Ubi Soft in 2001. The distribution offices were no longer mentioned. Blue Byte would continue to work on The Settlers series, but occasionally assist with other Ubisoft titles, mainly strategies. After Related Designs was acquired by Ubisoft in 2013, they were renamed to Blue Byte Mainz and the two studios would collaborate closely. A third studio, Ubisoft Berlin, joined the Blue Byte label in 2018. To differentiate itself from them, the Düsseldorf studio was officially renamed to Ubisoft Düsseldorf in August of the same year. The Blue Byte name, while no longer belonging to a single development studio, would still occasionally be used in credits or to refer to the three studios as a whole.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/2cd058fa-c4e7-11ed-85ec-02420a00013a.webp,1989,2024,Germany
Versus Evil LLC,"Versus Evil was an American video game publisher. It was founded in 2013 by Steve Escalante to focus on independently developed games. Escalante was previously Marketing Director at ZeniMax Online Studios. Prominent titles published by Versus Evil include The Banner Saga, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, UnMetal and First Class Trouble. The company boasted a full suite of support services: marketing, PR, influencer outreach, social media, community, QA, localization, and development services to reach other platforms. For QA, a separate company Red Cerberus was created, based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and it was established in cooperation with the Brazilian studio Fire Horse. Versus Evil published games on all major mobile, PC and next gen consoles, and worked with indie studios around the world in North America, South America and Europe. The team had presences in California, Texas, Maryland, New York, London and the Netherlands. Another publisher, tinyBuild, acquired the company in November 2021. Escalante, Versus Evil's head of production James Lance and previous owner Stall Proof LLC later filed legal claims against tinyBuild, claiming it had breached three obligations of the purchase agreement: that tinyBuild had filed to make ""timely capital contributions"" to Versus Evil during fiscal years 2022 and 2023, that it had not released funds held back under the terms of the agreement, and that it failed to provide promised material support. Meanwhile, Escalante made a claim of its own, alleging that tinyBuild failed to pay him the promised $3 million in shares and options in a timely manner. In early December tinyBuild announced to have agreed to pay the claimants $3.5 million in case, in addition to legal costs. Escalante left the studio around the same time and on 22 December 2023, all staff were laid off and the company was closed.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/53fffa3c-a102-11ee-9b49-02420a000136.webp,2013,2024,United States

"Indie Built, Inc.","The company was founded in 1983 by Bruce Carver (President) and Chris Jones (CFO) as Access Software Inc. Their company grew quickly with the success of such early titles as Beachhead and their first golf game, World Class Leader Board. In 1989, Access Software began their best-known contributions to computer gaming, with the release of Mean Streets. Although the game was initially intended to be only a flight simulator, its developers added a framing story featuring a futuristic detective named Tex Murphy. A sequel to Mean Streets (minus the flight simulator) was released in 1991, and Martian Memorandum went on to win the Software Publishers Association (SPA) Adventure Game of the Year award. Three years later, Under a Killing Moon became one of the first major CD-ROM games and was named Adventure Game of the Year by numerous magazines and organizations, including the SPA. A fourth Tex Murphy game, The Pandora Directive, earned yet another Adventure Game of the Year award in 1996. The final (to date) chapter of the Tex Murphy series was 1997's Overseer, and was one of the first games ever designed specifically for DVD. Access Software was most widely identified with the Links series, which teed off in 1990 with the release of Links: The Challenge of Golf. This groundbreaking, wildly popular product revolutionized computer golf games, spawned a series of brilliant iterations, and is still going strong today. Access and Microsoft first linked up in 1992 with the release of Microsoft Golf, based on the original version of Links. Later collaborations included Links for Windows, which utilized the Links 386 game engine. On 20 April 1998, Access was acquired by Microsoft and became known as Indie Built. They participated in the launch of Xbox on the holidays of 2001 with Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding. In October 2004, Indie Built, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) as part of the 2K Games brand, focusing on sports titles for the next generation of gaming consoles and the PC platform. Indie Built was a part of the 2K Sports label, together with Kush Games and Visual Concepts Entertainment. In April, 2006, Take-Two shut down Indie Built, Inc.

"Midway Games, Inc.","Midway Games Inc. was a developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software, for a wide range of platforms. It is especially known for the Mortal Kombat franchise. Based with a corporate office in Chicago, Illinois, the company had many worldwide divisions and subsidiaries. Its west coast division, Midway Home Entertainment, Inc., operated out of San Diego, California. It was formed in 1988, after Bally Midway Mfg Co. was acquired by WMS Industries under the name WMS Games Inc. (which was quickly changed to Midway Manufacturing Company). Initially Midway Games Inc. handled the coin-op arcade manufacture and sales out of its Chicago location, while Midway Home Entertainment developed games for home consoles from its west coast units. In 1998 it was set free by its owner WMS Industries and became its own company, owned by its stockholders. Eventually their Corsicana site was closed down and the company chose the San Diego location for its west coast hub. In 2001 Midway quit coin-op game manufacturing and sold all of the assets to Happ Control, Inc. In February 2008, the Midway conglomerate employed approximately 900 people (about 700 development staff and about 100 in sales and marketing departments).  On 12th February 2009 the company announced that the company and its U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The filing did not include the company's non-U.S. operations, which continued business.

(...-2009, bought out and rebranded Tradewest Games Ltd.)  After closing a number of studios in 2008, on 12 February 2009 the company filed for bankruptcy.

"Midway Games West, Inc.","AT Games Inc. was founded on January 10, 1985 as a subsidiary of Namco America Inc. for the purpose of acquiring the coin-op assets of Atari Games Inc. from Warner Communications Inc. The acquisition was completed by February 4 of that year, with Warner acquiring a minority stake of the new company as part of the transaction.  AT Games Inc. was renamed Atari Games Corporation on February 19, 1985. In 1987, Namco sold 20% of the company to Atari Games management, becoming an independent company. On December of that year, Tengen, Inc. was established as Atari Games' home consumer division (ownership of the Atari brand for the consumer market was held at the time by Atari Corporation). Namco sold its share of Atari Games in 1990, while in turn, Time Warner would become majority owner of the company. In 1994, Atari Games, Tengen and Time Warner Interactive Group were consolidated under the label of Time Warner Interactive. Atari Games would retain it's identity during this period, while the Tengen brand was discontinued. Time Warner sold Atari Games to WMS Industries Inc. on March 29, 1996. WMS would later transfer the company to its subsidiary, Midway Games, Inc. in July of that year. Midway spun off from WMS in 1998. Atari Games Corporation was renamed Midway Games West Inc. on November 19, 1999, and the Atari Games brand was discontinued in favor of the Midway brand, done likely to lessen confusion with the consumer Atari brand, then recently acquired by Hasbro Interactive, Inc. Midway exited the coin-op business in 2001 due to increasing losses and began to focus exclusively on the home consumer market.  The Midway West campus in Milpitas, CA was closed on February 7, 2003. As such, the subsidiary transitioned into a holding company for the Atari Games/Midway West properties. After filing for bankruptcy, Midway Games Inc. sold most of its assets to Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. in 2009, which included the Atari Games/Midway West library. Midway Games West Inc. was dissolved as a legal entity on October 2, 2013. In its history, the company also had many titles in development that were eventually canceled. These include:  Vicious Circle: a fighting game in the style of Killer Instinct which was pitched internally at Atari in 1994 as Hero.

"Apogee Software, Ltd.","Apogee Software, Ltd. is a Texas Limited Partnership whose General Partner is Action Entertainment, Inc., a Texas Corporation. Apogee's first breakthrough was in shareware marketing. Known in the shareware industry as the ""Apogee model,"" the method of releasing a portion of a full game (an ""episode"") as shareware (years before the Internet became popular) was risky and innovative, and done well before other PC game publishers released demos of their games. Among other innovations popularized by Apogee in early years include cheat codes (standard practice for their games as far back as in 1987), level warps and the so-called ""god"" invincibility mode. Apogee's games, and later 3D Realms' games, have always included skill levels and save/load game options, both rare in action games in the late 80's and early 90's. Apogee is considered the founder and father of the local Dallas-area game development community, with most of the top developers in this area having strong connections to them. For example, id Software located there to have a closer working relationship with them during the development of Wolfenstein 3D. Ritual Entertainment was formed by several developers from Apogee. Ion Storm co-founder Tom Hall left 3D Realms to follow his dream of owning his own company where ""Design is law."" Many of their developers have also gone on to become key members at non-local companies, such as Valve and n-Space. The Apogee label, for all purposes, was slated to be phased out after having been responsible for nearly 30 PC games, including Beyond the Titanic, Supernova, Kroz, Pharaoh's Tomb, Commander Keen, the original Duke Nukem in 1991, Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, Word Rescue, Math Rescue, Wolfenstein 3-D, Blake Stone, Raptor, Wacky Wheels, Rise of the Triad, Death Rally and Stargunner.

"Realtime Associates, Inc.","Founded in 1986, Realtime Associates is one of the longest standing independent interactive entertainment development studios in operation today. Having released over 80 titles since its inception, Realtime Associates has the longevity and stability to insure, reliable, professional console video game production.  In 1986, David Warhol brought together a loosely-knit group of ex Mattel Electronics employees to develop new game cartridges for the Intellivision system, which was successfully re-introduced into the retail channel by INTV Corporation prior to the Nintendo Entertainment System’s market introduction. Eventually writing about 25 new, enhanced, and licensed Intellivision game cartridges, Realtime Associates was born.  Shortly thereafter, with the NES taking the market by storm, Realtime began supporting that platform, notably developing the critically acclaimed NES version of Maniac Mansion (in conjunction with LucasArts games) as well as licensed games for Dick Tracy and The Rocketeer. As systems advanced, so did Realtime; adapting LucasArts, Loom to the NEC TurboGraphics, extending Q*Bert gameplay and graphics onto the SNES, and developing a number of licensed and original SNES and Genesis games.

The company was originally founded as DreamWorks Interactive in 1995 as a subsidiary of the film studio DreamWorks SKG. After a two-year publishing partnership with the studio, during which notable PlayStation titles as Trespasser: The Lost World and the original Medal of Honor were made, Electronic Arts acquired the company in February 2000 and renamed it Electronic Arts Los Angeles (EALA). The team would be best known for continuing the Medal of Honor series, as well as Clive Barker's Undying. In early 2003, Electronic Arts merged two other studios into EALA: Westwood Studios and EA Pacific. These would form the RTS division that would only be separately mentioned in their games' credits. This team would continue developing games in the Command & Conquer franchise, as well as The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth series.

Impressions Games,"Impressions Games was a UK software development house founded in 1989 by David Lester. Its focus was on strategy and business games, including sports-team management simulations. It also experimented with edutainment (Project USA) and casual software (Casino Deluxe). With a stable of partners and freelancers, including Edward Grabowski and Simon Bradbury, the company grew into a stable, successful studio. After initial success in the European market, in 1992 Impressions opened a US division in Farmington, Connecticut, which eventually moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. The division first focused on repackaging current UK Impressions releases with minor localization, but within two years grew into a full-fledged development house. In its first years in the US, Impressions would release between five and eight titles in a year, though by 1995 they had slowed down to a roughly two-titles-per-year schedule. During these early years Impressions also partnered with Connecticut-based Omnitrend Software and released two of its titles, Rules of Engagement 2 and Breach 3. Impressions attempted to carve new ground in strategy games, with a special emphasis placed on: business simulations as in Air Bucks, Detroit, and Powerhouse; empire-builders such as Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus; and the proto-real-time-strategy games of the Micro Miniatures series (including Conquest of Japan and Rorke's Drift). Impressions' biggest successes were in the Lords of the Realm and Caesar series, both of which came from collaboration between Lester and programmer/designer Simon Bradbury. The early games Impressions produced were uniquely tuned to the European games market, which seemed willing to accept a higher degree of complexity and lower degree of usability than in America. Impressions' first success in the US came when its Air Bucks title was taken off the market in its original UK edition, significantly upgraded with new features and a revised interface, and re-released as Air Bucks v1.2. Impressions was bought by Sierra On-Line in 1995, who released Caesar II to critical and commercial success. After many years running the company, Lester passed creative leadership of the company to Chris Beatrice, who oversaw most of its remaining titles, most of which were part of the City Building series. Lester went on to form Firefly Studios in 1999 with Simon Bradbury and Eric Ouellette (Lester eventually moved on from Firefly as well, and became a UK magazine publisher). During the development of Lords of the Realm III, a management shake-up ended with the departure of Beatrice and much of the company's leadership and senior staff, to form a new studio called Tilted Mill Entertainment. Edward Grabowski, who was crucial to the birth of Impressions, went on to do racing management simulations for MicroProse, and later released games to the web through his own company, Edward Grabowski Communications, Ltd. Vivendi Universal Games closed the studio in April 2004. After the Activision Blizzard merger in 2008, the City Building franchise would remain with the holding company, but Lords of the Realm was sold off to Rebellion Developments.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/1d8b6b5e-bc82-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1989,2024,United States

"Westwood Studios, Inc.","In 1985, Brett W. Sperry and Louis Castle set to work in a garage in Las Vegas. Thus was born Westwood Studios.  Among their early creations are Mars Saga, BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception, DragonStrike and the first two Eye of the Beholder games, which garnered the young company its first taste of recognition at home and abroad. In 1992, the company merged with Virgin Interactive Entertainment, which enabled Westwood Studios to become a software publisher in its own right and to use Virgin's worldwide distribution network. It was also the year Westwood released The Legend of Kyrandia and Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty. They would also release the Lands of Lore series of role-playing games as of 1993. Soon after came Command & Conquer (1995) and Command & Conquer: Red Alert (1996), which set sales records and significantly impacted the RTS genre. Monopoly (1995) was their first commercial game with Internet support, using their proprietary Westwood Online (WOL) system, which their further releases would also use. The company's last adventure game was Blade Runner (1997). In August 1998, Westwood was acquired by Electronic Arts (EA) for $122.5 million in cash following Virgin Interactive's financial problems, and was joined by another studio previously owned by Virgin, which was then renamed to Westwood Pacific.  Westwood's main branding would regardless be used on games they would outsource to Westwood Pacific or other companies, including Dune 2000 (1998, by Intelligent Games), Recoil (1999, by Zipper Interactive), Sports Car GT (1999, by Westwood Pacific as additional developer for Image Space), and Nox (2000, by Westwood Pacific). In 1999, Westwood finished the long-awaited games which had suffered development issues: Lands of Lore III in March and Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun in August. In the same year, Brett Sperry pitched Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 to the Pacific studio, becoming the first major game in the series mainly developed by a company other than the main Las Vegas team, although they would contribute the engine, art and audio. The game would release in October 2000. The final game using Westwood's rights to the Dune license was Emperor: Battle for Dune in 2001, again mainly done by Intelligent Games. Westwood would release their final three games in 2002: Command & Conquer: Renegade, Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat and Earth & Beyond. Renegade and Earth & Beyond failed to meet Electronic Arts' expectations, so EA liquidated Westwood Studios in March 2003. Those employees that were willing to do so moved to EA Los Angeles' RTS division along with EA Pacific. While some, including Westwood co-founder Louis Castle, accepted, others remained in Las Vegas and founded Petroglyph Games not far from Westwood's office. Since EA's acquisition, the company had handled a large amount of projects which would never end up released, many in concept stage at the point of cancellation. Known among them were: Swords & Sorcery: Come Devils, Come Darkness (later picked up by Heuristic Park and released as Wizards & Warriors in 2000), iterations of Command & Conquer 3: Incursion, Command & Conquer: Continuum, Command & Conquer: Renegade 2.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/02eef67e-bc84-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1986,2022,

Outside of Japan, the company is best known as the parent company of Quest Corporation, the creators of the Ogre Battle series. The company met its demise after going through a legal battle with Yoshiki Tanaka over a breach of licensing terms for the Legend of Galactic Heroes franchise and had to cancel most of the major titles it was developing at the time, as well as shut down its Legend of Galactic Heroes VII online game. As a result, Bothtec was on the verge of bankruptcy and was acquired by BBMF in 2005. In 2006, Bothtec transferred all its IPs, as well as the Project EGG service to D4 Enterprise, a company established by their former employees.

The company invested in sales and marketing teams, made multi-lingual packaging and put its programmers in offices. Two so-called Mega Games were announced - Spectrum titles that would come with hardware add-ons to vastly expand the abilities of the platform. The announced titles Bandersnatch and Psyclapse were never released however. By mid-1984 they collapsed, citing massive debts, especially to magazines for advertising. Five of their programmers went on to form Denton Designs. Butler and Lawson were key figures at Psygnosis, while the Imagine name was bought by Ocean, who mainly used it for Konami arcade conversions - Bubble Bobble and Arkanoid were notable successes - before phasing the label out in the late 80s.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/920a6fe2-ab6c-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp,1982,2024,

TT Games Studios Ltd.,"Traveller's Tales is a UK development studio founded in 1989 by Jon Burton. With the artist Andy Ingram, whom he met in a computer shop in his home town in Southport, they created the studio's first game Leander, published in 1991 by Psygnosis. The game was ported to the Mega Drive in 1992 as The Legend of Galahad with the help of Burton's demo team friend David Dootson who was later hired into the company. The team's second game Puggsy was published in 1993 and also involved Chris Stanforth at the studio, working on an unreleased SNES version. The studio's third game Bram Stoker's Dracula was released in the same year and became the studio's first licensed title. The revenue allowed the studio to set up shop officially above a pet store in Southport. Burton enjoyed turning licenses into games and working together with Sony they created Mickey Mania for Disney, released in 1994, followed by Disney's Toy Story in 1995. Their work attracted the attention of SEGA and that led to the games Sonic 3D Blast (1995) and Sonic R (1997). During the development of Sonic 3D Blast in 1994 the team was also working on a new Toy Story game and a project headed by artist Rodney Matthews. Burton wanted to split the work force into two teams to manage the titles better, with one working on the Matthews project, and then splitting the profits. However, his business partner Ingram went to Psygnosis and they offered to back him if he started his own company. Ingram, Stanforth and some others broke away to form the studio Tales² (later HammerHead). The Matthews project was finished there in 1998 as Shadow Master. They also did the PlayStation port of Quake II (1999), followed by the title Blade (2000) and Jinx (2003), but around 2002 the studio disbanded and Burton hired back the directors for Traveller's Tales. Around 1997 the studio was working on Sonic R (originally an F1 racing game) and the PlayStation platformer Rascal (1998). The studio employed about 25 people at the time. They worked on various licensed titles and also three years on an original project Haven: Call of the King, released in 2002. The period around 2005 was a busy time for the company. Traveller's Tales already moved from Southport to Knutsford (Cheshire) and opened a new development studio in Oxford. That studio completed two titles: Crash Twinsanity (2004) and Super Monkey Ball Adventure (2006), but Burton found the distance between the offices difficult to manage all projects properly and the Oxford location was then closed. The release of LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game in 2005 was a turning point for the company. Traveller's Tales was given the chance to develop a game based on a new LEGO toy line, while LEGO itself pitched the concept of LEGO Star Wars to LucasArts, who brought it to Traveller's Tales as they in turn had previously attempted to convince LucasArts Haven: Call of the King could become a Star Wars game. Through business deals LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game was published by Giant Interactive Entertainment, Ltd. Burton was not happy with the arrangement and in 2005 the company merged with Giant Interactive Entertainment to form Tt Games Ltd., combining development at Traveller's Tales with the publishing division Tt Games Publishing Ltd. The game was an incredible success and Tt Games got a lot of revenue, handling development but also the publishing royalties. Apart from a few other licenses such as Bionicle Heroes (2006), Transformers: The Game (2007) and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008), the studio has since been working exclusively on adapting existing franchises to LEGO environments, often for many platforms at once. In 2006 Tt Animation was established and in January 2007 Embryonic Studios was acquired as an additional studio, then renamed Tt Fusion Ltd. In November 2007 the company was acquired by Warner Bros. Tt Games Ltd. is the company that encompasses both development by Traveller's Tales and Tt Fusion, and publishing by Tt Games Publishing, so all original development not done by Tt Fusion is listed here.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/25e0142e-bc75-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1991,2023,

"NovaLogic, Inc.","Founded in 1985 by CEO John A. Garcia, NovaLogic Inc. was a developer and global publisher of computer games for the PC, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game consoles, Nintendo GameCube and Xbox video game system.

A European office was set up in 1994 in central London to manage distribution, sales and marketing throughout Europe. Headed by the General Manager, Paul Rebhan, the office comprised 12 staff, bringing the total number of NovaLogic employees to about 100 worldwide.  NovaLogic spent its early years producing home versions of many popular arcade games and has produced designs for more than a decade.  Success in the consumer military simulation market brought NovaLogic to the attention of the US Army. In 1999, NovaLogic Systems Inc. (NLS) was established to capitalize on the technologies NovaLogic had developed for the gaming market by bringing them to the military and civilian training communities. NLS has worked with several US Army commands, notably as provider of training software for the Land Warrior soldier system. NovaLogic also has continued strategic partnerships with defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Sikorsky.  Throughout NovaLogic’s history, the company has developed original gaming content for both console and PC platforms and although NovaLogic is best known for developing military combat simulations, the company has, over the years, expanded its portfolio of titles.

They started as a conversion house, adapting coin-op titles to console and PC (e.g. Manx TT SuperBike), and designing a cross-platform engine. They later starting porting between consoles, converting WipeOut (PSX) to other platforms, and working on Unreal II for the Xbox. Their first original title was South Park Rally, completed for four platforms in just 7 months. Their first handheld game was ATV: Quad Power Racing for the GameBoy Advance, and they released Space Race, their first PS2 game, the same year. They used two cross-platform engines: CRIS for handhelds, with skinned mesh rendering, and The Mercury Engine for new generation consoles. In its early years. The developer’s best performing title was the 2007 girl’s horse riding simulator Pony Friends for the Nintendo DS which sold more than 1 million copies, making it the largest-selling single-format game developed in Australia. During this time the companies in-house engine was updated to become Hydra, a multi-platform compiler and exporter that could export data from a single Maya file into multiple platforms. In December 2008 Tantalus established an office in Brisbane at the time and across two offices employed just over 70 staff. During that time the studio worked on Disney•Pixar Cars: Race-O-Rama and MX vs ATV Reflex for the DS and PSP, as well as Pony Friends 2 for the Wii and DS. Shortly after the completion of Cars: Race-O-Rama (DS) in 2009 the Brisbane studio started work on the company's first digitally distributed title Drift Street International for the DSi. Meanwhile the Melbourne office worked on Megamind: The Blue Defender for PSP and DS, while also prototyping demos for 360, iPhone, and PS3. During the last half of 2009, due to a shift in the games industry in Australia, Tantalus Media closed its Brisbane office, while also making much of the staff in the Melbourne office redundant. During the first half of 2010 the company was reduced to a staff of under 18. At a time when many Australian development studios were closing Tantalus seemed to weather the storm. In the early 2010s, the company would focus on titles for the Nintendo DS, Sony PSP and iPhone/iPad. Since the latter half of the 2010s, they were mainly involved with ports and remasters of other studios' titles, most notably Stellaris, the Definitive Editions of the Age of Empires series, Cities: Skylines, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon and others. On 18 March 2021, they were acquired by Keywords Studios.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/0c5d0522-d657-11ef-b0c4-02420a00014c.webp,1995,2025,Australia

"Crystal Dynamics, Inc.","Crystal Dynamics (Crystal), founded in 1992 by Judy Lang, Madaline Canepa and Dave Morris, is a leading publisher and developer of interactive entertainment software for the console and personal computer (“PC”) market. The founders wanted the name of the company to reflect the “New Technology” Compact Discs (CD) that games would be played on. So they came up with a list of C and D names, tried different combinations and felt that Crystal Dynamics worked well together; Crystal for hard, solid foundation and Dynamics for fluid, ever changing industry. At its headquarters in Menlo Park, CA, the company operates similar to an independent film studio, internally develops and markets wholly owned properties, which are then distributed to the retail marketplace through strategic relationships with distribution partners. The company was the first to develop and publish a 32-bit console-format video game, Crash 'N Burn for the 3DO, which was also their first game. In late 1998, Crystal Dynamics became incorporated into Eidos.  Crystal develops its products internally and seeks to publish and develop interactive entertainment software titles that are, or have the potential to become, franchise titles that can be leveraged across several releases and/or platforms. Crystal Dynamics’ successful franchise properties include Tomb Raider, Legacy of Kain, and others. In August 2018, the studio opened a second operation in Seattle, Washington named Crystal Northwest, with staff largely coming from the closed Wargaming Seattle. In May 2021, Crystal Southwest was opened in Austin, Texas, led by Dallas Dickinson.

"Her Interactive, Inc.","Founded in 1995, Her Interactive began its life as ""Games For Her"", a division of American Laser Games located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. As part of American Laser, their primary function was the development of ""live-action"" software specifically for girls. Their first title, McKenzie & Co., was released that same year followed in 1996 by The Vampire Diaries. In 1997, the Her Interactive division secured the much-sought-after rights to produce games starring Nancy Drew, the famous teenage detective, from copyright owner Simon & Schuster. It is with this license that the company became most famous. In an unprecedented move, Her Interactive bought out American Laser in 1999. The following year, Her Interactive sold American Laser to Digital Leisure Inc. As quoted from the Her Interactive website:  ""Her Interactive creates intelligent interactive entertainment for girls of all ages. The company designs, develops and markets award-winning interactive CD-ROM games that offer role-playing mysteries and adventures that girls and adventurous sleuths find both challenging and fun. Her Interactive's Nancy Drew series offers exciting adventure game play without violence or gender stereotypes. With years of experience developing games for girls the company will continue to identify opportunities for interactive products for girls.  Our corporate mission is to lead the industry toward a new standard of intelligent interactive entertainment for girls. By providing role-playing experiences through computer games and online media, Her Interactive's goal is to open the doors of technology to girls by making computers more appealing.""   Most of Her Interactive's games have been initially released for Windows, with some ported to other platforms later. The company's first game for the Macintosh was McKenzie & Co. released in 1995. The company re-entered the Macintosh gaming market with Win/Mac hybrid release of Nancy Drew: Trail of the Twister in June 2010.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/3b95ccce-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1995,2024,United States

ASCARON Entertainment GmbH,"Ascaron was a computer game company headquartered in Gütersloh, Germany. The company was founded in 1991 under the name Ascon by Holger Flöttmann and developed entertainment software for the German market for 18 years, with games franchises like Patrician, Port Royale, Anstoss (On the Ball) and Sacred. Later it also became known for its publishing and distribution activities. In August 2001, the company went into administration for the first time. However, the reestablishment of the company keeping all IPRs and brands made it possible for Ascaron to continue its operative business and to survive.  In July 2002, Ascaron expanded by opening a wholly-owned subsidiary, Studio II Software in the University City, Aachen (Germany) and in September 2002, the first international office, Ascaron Entertainment (UK) Ltd. with its main office in Birmingham, was founded. After many years of continuity the company got into financial difficulties once more. According to a spokesman of Ascaron this was due to immense costs and extended time for the development of Sacred 2: Fallen Angel. On 14 April 2009, Ascaron Entertainment went into administration again. This time, the company did not recover and negotiations began with ""several well-known interested parties"" to discuss a positive takeover.  In June 2009, Kalypso Media acquired the majority of licenses and assets of company when the firm entered insolvency. Among the intellectual properties acquired were Port Royale, Darkstar One, Anstoss (On the Ball) and Patrician. However, certain titles distributed online by Strategy First since 2008 would remain with the latter. On 18 June 2009, it was announced that fifteen former employees of Ascaron would be part of Kalypso's newly acquired studio Gaming Minds Studios. The Sacred intellectual property would be fully acquired by its European publisher, Koch Media, following the release of the last ASCARON-branded title, Sacred 2: Ice & Blood in August 2009.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/27f7d45a-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1991,2009,Germany

Raven Software Corporation,"Raven Software is a computer game developer based in Madison, Wisconsin. The company was founded in 1990 by brothers Brian and Steve Raffel, and initially had a staff of five people. Their first game was Black Crypt (1992). Later, they shifted their focus from first-person RPGs to first-person shooters, a genre in which they created their best-known works such as Heretic and Hexen, Soldier of Fortune and other series, primarily in engines made by id Software or their derivatives.  In 1997, Raven Software made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was eventually acquired by that company.  During the time they shared a published with id Software in Activision, the two companies would closely collaborate, and Raven would even lead the development of Quake 4 and Wolfenstein (2009) instead of id Software. Additionally, Raven Software would develop several games making use of Activision's Marvel license in the mid-to-late-2000s. After id Software was acquired by ZeniMax Media in 2009, Raven Software would no longer use id Tech engines. Their last standalone title was Singularity from 2010, which used Unreal Engine 3. After this, Raven Software would assist in development and support of the Call of Duty franchise, starting with Call of Duty: Black Ops in 2011.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/ee1a22ce-b8a2-11ef-accd-02420a000116.webp,1992,2025,United States
Relic Entertainment Inc,"Vancouver, Canada-based Relic Entertainment develops electronic entertainment. It was founded in May 1997 by Alex Garden, Luke Moloney, Erin Daly, Aaron Kambeitz, Rob Cunningham, Gary Shaw, and Shane Alfreds. Operations began in a modest 1600 sq. foot office upstairs from a popular nightclub. In April of 1998, Relic made the move to its new 12,000 sq. foot world class facility in Vancouver's historic Yaletown district. The studio’s first title was the space strategy game Homeworld (1999). Publisher Sierra Entertainment continued the franchise in 2000 with Homeworld: Cataclysm, but by a different development studio. Their next title Impossible Creatures arrived four years later in 2003, a real-time strategy game for Microsoft Game Studios where the units were animals that could have their genes modified to inherit different traits. It was received fairly well, but received less attention than their first title. Shortly after, a sequel to Homeworld was released as Homeworld 2, also in 2003. Reviews were generally positive, but it made less of an impact than the first game. In April 2004 the studio was acquired by the publishing house THQ for close to $10 million in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition was completed in May. Later that year, the studio released the fantasy strategy title Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War based on the tabletop Warhammer 40,000 universe. Over the years, the studio released multiple expansions: Winter Assault (2005), Dark Crusade (2006) and Soulstorm (2008). The last expansion was done by Iron Lore Entertainment, but received post-release support from Relic due to Iron Lore's closure weeks before it shipped. Previously only creating games for computers, the studio’s first and only console title was The Outfit (2006), a shooter set during World War II that was received fairly well, but less than their other titles. Much more successful was the launch of the Company of Heroes franchise, started with Company of Heroes in 2006 and followed up with the Opposing Fronts and Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor expansions in 2007 and 2009 respectively. Again set during World War II, they featured squad-based strategy gameplay. There were also rumours that Relic was looking to reacquire the Homeworld franchise from publisher Vivendi to create a third game in their sci-fi series. Through the discovery of a document at the trademark office, THQ eventually confirmed that Relic owned the trademark once again, making it possible to create a new title for THQ. However, the IP was eventually bought by Gearbox Software in 2013 and the next game in the Homeworld series, Deserts of Kharak was developed by Blackbird Interactive. In February 2009, the Dawn of War sequel Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II was released. In September 2011, they would ship the third-person shooter Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. Following the closure of parent company THQ in January 2013, the studio was sold to SEGA. As part of the acquisition, SEGA also brought their IPs Company of Heroes and Dawn of War from THQ. Soon afterwards, Company of Heroes 2 was released. After the unsuccessful Dawn of War III, Relic Entertainment was contracted by Microsoft Studios to develop Age of Empires IV and contribute to the codebases of the earlier Age of Empires titles' Definitive Editions. The former was released in October 2021. In their returning title to the SEGA-owned part of their portfolio, Relic Entertainment announced Company of Heroes 3 in July 2021, with a short open pre-alpha playtest session soon after announcement. The full version of the game was released in February 2023. On 28 March 2024, the company became independent from SEGA. Between February and June 2025, Relic's titles published under SEGA would become self-published and would no longer use SEGA's community forum system. On 4 September 2025, the company revealed the Relic Labs label, meant for games that have smaller teams and shorter development cycles, starting with Earth vs Mars.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/afd32cf4-bc78-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1999,2025,

Wolf Team,"This Telenet Japan subsidiary was founded in 1987, and initially headed by Masahiro Akishino. It went independent for 2 years, then got folded back in. It is known for its work with Japanese PCs, the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis), and the Super Famicom (SNES). They developed Zan, Arcus, and Hiōden games. In 1993, it was restructured, as part of a Telenet Japan initiative to reduce costs. Some staff resisted the change, including Wolf Team head, Masahiro Akishino, producer  Masaaki Uno  (went to  Camelot Software), Sega Genesis programmers  Toshio Toyota  and  Yukihiko Tani  (aka bugtaro) (both co-founded Gau Entertainment ). Wolf Team producer Joe Asanuma took the helm at this time. Due to the poor sales of their games, they needed to seek an outside financier to publish and market their next game, based on the novel Tale Phantasia, written by Yoshiharu Gotanda. After seeing bids from some companies, such as Enix and Namco, they signed on with the agreement made by Namco. Namco made many marketing changes to the game, which struck a protest from Yoshiharu Gotanda, and Masaki Norimoto. Many people on the team supported them, and these protests saw Joe Asanuma get ousted for his lack of ability to solve these protests, so they brought in Eiji Kikuchi  to direct the game. This brought up the idea for the protesters to start up their own company. After Tales of Phantasia was released, most of the development staff left Wolf Team. Most of this development staff went to participate in the founding of Tri-Ace. Only Motoi Sakuraba, Shinji Tamura and Eiji Kikuchi remained with Wolf Team after this breakup. Wolf Team kept developing the Tales games for Namco, and did some sports games on the side for Telenet Japan. In 2003, the remains of Wolf Team were dissolved, and the remaining staff were transferred into a new subsidiary known as Namco Tales Studio, and develops the series for its financier and publisher, Namco.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d3c61b2e-bc7a-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1986,2013,Japan

Rabbit Software Ltd,"Founded in 1982, earlier than most other videogame start-ups of that time, Rabbit started as an offshoot of Cream Computers, a shop in Harrow (North London) that specialised in business micros. One of the employees wrote software and they decided to sell some games by mail. The games had very basic packaging: cream coloured paper with a rabbit stamped on it and hand-written details. Along with the buzz of the Vic-20 release, the company became quickly known for their Vic-20 and Commodore 64 games. The company hired a tele-sales team and made sure their games were available from different major computer outlets; a risk at the time. They started producing games for the Spectrum at the end of 1983 and soon had the titles Escape MCP, Race Fun, Phantasia, The Birds, Frogger, Lancer Lords, Murder, Pakacuda, Paratroopers, Potty Painter, Centropods and Quackers. In 1984, the company moved to Wealdstone and they no longer had in-house programmers. Producer/Director Terry Grant thought up the ideas and then contracted programmers. In that year, they released the Spectrum game Death Star. Because software producers had difficulty maintaining stocks for chain stores, Terry Grant and Heather Lamont founded Copy-Soft to offer a full scale service to all software houses, including inlay design and printing, right through to bulk copying and delivery. By 1985 Virgin Games acquired the Rabbit Software name and used it as a publishing label to sell mid-priced titles on a range of machines, including the Spectrum. The first game released on this new label was The Great Fire of London.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/5882e084-ab6b-11ed-a44e-02420a000199.webp,1982,1985,United Kingdom

Factor 5 GmbH,"Based in San Rafael, California, originally founded in Cologne (Germany) in 1987 and privately held, Factor 5 LLC is a developer of interactive entertainment software and technology for a variety of console and computer platforms. The team members come from the hacker scene and demo programming. They originally called themselves Light Circle, but then changed their name to avoid associations with their not-so-legal past, and since there were 5 members it became Factor 5. The first project was the Amiga game Katakis (1988), an R-Type clone. They were sued by Activision Europe for copying the concept, and were only allowed to hold on to the right to sell the game if they did the Amiga conversion for R-Type. They complied, and after that, they programming the scrolling 2D shoot-em-up Turrican for the Amiga, inspired by Metroid and Contra. The game did remarkably well, so they created a sequel and then pondered porting it to other systems and consoles. In 1991, the team members decided to give up their studies and officially open the company. Another reason was they needed to have the status of an official company to receive a development system fro Nintendo. They went on to create many sequels to and conversions of Turrican, for consoles such as the Genesis and the SNES as well. In those years, they received financial backing from Softgold (Europe). They ended up in San Rafael when they met a new Lucasfilm Games producer in 1989: Kalani Streicher. At the time, Factor 5 did the German localization of Lucasfilm Games, of which Softgold was the distributor, and they visited the Skywalker Ranch in the US to sort out localization issues. They met again at the CES in 1992, where Kalani told the members he was impressed with Super Turrican on the SNES, and offered them a project at the company. There were six to choose from, and they picked Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures (SNES). It was the first time they worked with a big license and a strict schedule. Next, Sony's PlayStation was launched and because they were quite tech-savvy, they were offered to do a PSX game for LucasArts. They made a modern version of BallBlazer: Ballblazer Champions, but had a hard time developing the game, because they had never done 3D before. The next project was the PSX conversion of Star Wars: Rebel Assault II - The Hidden Empire. In 1998, they turned to the Nintendo 64 console, as they preferred working with cartridges. They created Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 3D, Star Wars: Episode I - Battle for Naboo and the N64 port of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. At that time, they were also working on a modern version of Turrican: Thornado, similar to One, but the game was first moved to the GameCube, and later cancelled. They couldn't name the game Turrican as Softgold still held the rights. Factor 5 has also created the multi-platform MusyX’ sound tool technology which pioneered 5-channel Dolby Surround Pro-Logic II sound for games in close collaboration with Dolby, the DivX’ video toolset for multiple game platforms, and, as a Nintendo technology partner, was involved in the creation of the Nintendo GameCube hardware. For the GameCube, they continued with the Star Wars license, creating Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II - Rogue Leader and Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III - Rebel Strike. In 2004, Factor 5 announced to start developing for next-gen consoles. In 2005, Factor 5 announced it would move away from producing franchise games and start developing their own IP.  They have become an exclusive partner of Sony Computer Entertainment of America and held up their reputation of stretching the limits of any new system with the release of a title for the PlayStation 3: Lair in September of 2007. Recently, Factor 5 has incorporated in the State of California and is now going under the name of Factor 5, Inc.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/6e3337f2-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1988,2024,United States

Parker Brothers,"Parker Brothers is most well known as the creator of numerous successful board games such as Monopoly, Clue, and Risk. The company has been manufacturing games for well over a century. George S. Parker founded the George S. Parker Company in 1883 to sell his first board game called Banking. When his brother, Charles, joined him in the business in 1888, the name was changed to Parker Brothers. The company remained family owned until 1968, when the company was purchased by General Mills. The company's first forays into electronic gaming came in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when they began to produce electronic versions of their popular board games. Parker Brothers entered the video game market in 1982. They originally produced games for the Atari 2600, Odyssey 2, Intellivision, Atari 5200, and ColecoVision consoles as well as for various computer systems. They primarily licensed successful arcade and computer titles from other companies and produced few original titles. After the video game crash of 1983-84, the company briefly left the video game business. In 1985, Parker Brothers joined Kenner Products to form a new company called Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. In 1987, Kenner Parker Toys was acquired by the Tonka Corporation. That same year, Sega of America inked a deal with Tonka to market their Master System console, which was experiencing sluggish sales. Tonka marketed and distributed Sega's 8-bit system from 1987 to 1989, and during that time Parker Brothers developed several games exclusively for that system. Sales of the Master System did not improve under Tonka, however, and in late 1989, Sega ended their relationship with Tonka. With this, Parker Brothers once again left the video game business. Tonka Corporation was acquired by Hasbro, Inc. in 1991 and Parker Brothers remains a division of Hasbro to this day.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/816bd522-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1977,2025,

ADK Corporation,"Alpha Denshi (アルファ電子) was an electronics and software engineering company established in July 1980 in Saitama, Japan, headed by Kazuo Arai. The company originally dealt in communications equipment, but released its first arcade game in May 1981: Janputer, arguably the world's first true mahjong video game. The company developed a number of titles for Sega in the early '80s, but would soon become a strong ally of SNK. SNK's Neo Geo hardware, designed by Alpha Denshi's Eiji Fukatsu, was released to both arcades and homes around the world in 1990, and Alpha Denshi would be the platform's most prominent developer apart from SNK itself, releasing more than a dozen titles between 1990 and 1996, including fan-favorites such as World Heroes and Twinkle Star Sprites. The company shortened its name to ADK (エーディーケイ) at the start of 1993. Due to contractual limitations with SNK, the company launched Miraisoft (未来ソフト) in 1997 to publish titles for other platforms. However, the company was plagued by the same post-bubble financial troubles as SNK, and by the time of SNK's bankruptcy in 2001 was operating with only a skeleton staff. In its twilight years, ADK shifted its business toward mobile content and LCD games, but was ultimately forced to close sometime in 2003.

Digital Leisure Inc.,"Digital Leisure, Inc. was formed in 1997 with a vision of acquiring, re-mastering and publishing existing video-intensive games that would benefit from the superior video and audio quality of DVD and bringing these interactive titles to DVD movie players, PC DVD-ROM and PC CD-ROM systems. Digital Leisure first acquired the rights to Dragon’s Lair, Space Ace and Dragon’s Lair II: Time Warp in early 1997, the three games that redefined the gaming industry in the 1980s. The games were created by Rick Dyer and feature spectacular quality animation by Don Bluth, an ex-Disney animator who is also known for his work on All Dogs Go To Heaven, The Land Before Time and Anastasia. The company completely rewrote the code for the games to accurately duplicate the game-play of the arcade version, including scenes that were missing from many of the computer adaptations. The video was encoded with MPEG2 compression and AC3 audio from the original source and rivals the quality of the original laser disc. The games were released in 1998 and 1999 on various formats including CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, DVD-Video and PlayStation 2 and enabled the company to build its international distribution network of large chain stores and national distributors such as Toys R Us, Best Buy, Ingram Entertainment, Electronics Boutique, Babbage’s Etc. and others. The products continue to sell well for the company worldwide and form a strong base from which the company has built on. The company acquired the North American rights to publish ""Tender Loving Care"", an interactive movie on DVD-ROM and CD-ROM featuring Academy award nominee John Hurt in early 1999 which broadened the Digital Leisure line-up and met with commercial success. In mid-2000 the company acquired the worldwide publishing rights to Kingdom II: Shadoan, another Rick Dyer creation, for DVD-ROM , DVD-Video and CD-ROM. In early 2000, the company added the development and publishing rights of Hologram Time Traveler which was released in the fall of 2000. Selling over $18,000,000 in its arcade debut, Hologram Time Traveler remains the first and only coin-operated arcade game to deliver a real 3D hologram experience. With the release of the Sony PlayStation 2 in October 2000, the company seized the opportunity and re-branded its DVD-Video titles as ""PlayStation 2 Compatible"" (as the PlayStation 2 will play DVD movies, it also will play the company’s DVD-Video based games) and sold the games into the PlayStation 2 market as new releases with the release of the PlayStation 2 hardware, which met with great success for the company. Recently the company has acquired the development and worldwide publishing rights to the entire American Laser Games catalog of nine laser disc arcade titles including Mad Dog McCree, Crime Patrol and Who Shot Johnny Rock? These titles will be released over the next two years on CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and DVD-Video/PlayStation 2 with Mad Dog McCree and Who Shot Johnny Rock? having been released last Christmas season.  Going forward, Digital Leisure Inc. plans to continue bringing classic video-based games to the newest technologies of the future.

Firefly Holdings Limited,"FireFly Studios is a London-based development company founded in 1999 by Simon Bradbury and Eric Ouellette, who had previously worked on the Caesar and Lords of the Realm series for Impressions Games. Their debut title, the real-time strategy and city/castle building hybrid called FireFly Studios' Stronghold, was released in 2001 to public acclaim and set the tone for the studio's future portfolio. Although published by Gathering of Developers (by then a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive), the studio maintained control over the Stronghold intellectual property, which was rare at the time. The successful run continued with Stronghold Crusader, a 2002 Stronghold standalone expansion set in the Middle East during the earlier Crusades. The last game on that 2D engine was the 2003 management sim Space Colony, which was received lukewarmly. In 2005, FireFly released their first 3D game, Stronghold 2 as an evolution for the franchise in terms of mechanics and content, and followed it with the 2006 spin-off Stronghold Legends, which was poorly reviewed. Also in 2006, FireFly released CivCity: Rome produced by Firaxis Games, who had also licensed the usage of the Civilization IP for the game. In 2008, during the global financial crisis, the studio changed publishers to the short-lived Gamecock Media Group and released the panned Stronghold Crusader Extreme. Financially, the team was doing poorly and was at the only point in their history where they were forced to let parts of the studio go. A hack-and-slash RPG titled Dungeon Hero had to be cancelled around this time due to lack of funding. The publisher was changed again and back to 2K Games to release The Stronghold Collection in 2009. A skeleton team of 4 developers created the alpha version of Stronghold Kingdoms in 2010, and was released on Steam in early 2012, during the platform's start of supporting free-to-play games, eventually gaining a large player base. Meanwhile, in late 2011, the studio released Stronghold 3, poorly received mainly due to its poor optimization and visibly rushed development, which the studio claims to have been because of the pressure of their publisher at the time, an also short-lived 7Sixty LLC, to release the game at a particular time. In 2012, FireFly Studios decided to self-publish their games. Stronghold Crusader II was revealed at Gamescom 2012 and had a fundraising campaign meant to cover part of the development budget. Even though this campaign failed, the game was released in 2014 to some success. Very soon afterwards, the studio announced mobile ports of Stronghold Kingdoms and a new title codenamed Stronghold Next. In 2017, a dungeon crawler game called MetaMorph: Dungeon Creatures was announced, but after some time, its development was placed on the backburner. In 2019, the studio announced Romans: Age of Caesar, a game similar to Stronghold Kingdoms but set in ancient Rome, and at E3 2019, they fully announced Stronghold Next as Stronghold: Warlords after a prolonged period of teaser videos on YouTube revealing smaller details that the game would feature, with the game fully releasing in 2021. Although the main studio is in London, United Kingdom, two smaller branches were opened over time in the United States and in Scotland. However, by January 2019, the company was split in terms of creative development as teams developing Stronghold: Warlords and Romans: Age of Caesar, with supporting and updating Stronghold Kingdoms on the side. As of 4 November 2021, FireFly Studios became part of Devolver Digital. In April 2022, FireFly Studios was part of a large list of companies which adopted the then-new Unreal Engine 5 at the time of its full launch. They would confirm on 31 May 2022 that the next Stronghold title would be using that engine instead of the aging Vision engine their previous titles had used. On 7 November 2023, they released Stronghold: Definitive Edition, a full remaster of the original Stronghold which used the Unity engine as a wrapper for the original codebase.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/5862b9a4-b8b0-11ef-9fb5-02420a00011c.webp,2001,2025,Italy

Argonaut Games PLC,"Founded by Jez San, Argonaut Games Plc was a large independent games developer with a 24 year history of producing games. The company was based in Edgware, north London, UK, and at its peak boasted over 300 employees. Argonaut created numerous games, most notably Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, Alien: Resurrection and the first Harry Potter on the PlayStation for EA. Additionally, Argonaut developed the Super FX chip (used in the original SNES Star Fox title) for Nintendo, which ultimately became the foundation for a spin-off sister company, Argonaut RISC Cores. Argonaut worked with a wide range of publishers including SEGA, Nintendo, Virgin, Koei, Mitsui, 20th Century Fox, Electronic Arts, Sierra and Ubisoft. In 2000, the Argonaut board decided to float the company on the London AIM (Alternative Investments Market) stock-exchange, raising over £20m in working capital. A series of acquisitions followed, adding several small studios to the group, including Just Add Monsters (now Ninja Theory) and Particle Systems. However, the group struggled with both its new overheads and the fresh challenges in the transition from PlayStation to PS2 and Xbox. The company also had an office in Woodside, California, Argonaut USA. By 2004, after various setbacks, Argonaut's cash reserves were severely depleted, leading to the eventual closure of all of its studios, and the loss of several hundred jobs. Aside from Ninja Theory, London-based developer Rocksteady Studios rose from Argonaut's ashes, while another acquisition, mobile developer Morpheme, was active until 2008. Jez San went on to found online 3D poker company PKR.com. On 28 August 2024, Mike Arkin and Gary Sheinwald announced the relaunched company Argonaut Games, Inc..",https://cdn.mobygames.com/ba61d2ce-bc78-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1986,2025,United Kingdom

Croteam,"Croteam is a label of ABEST d.o.o.. It was initially started as a ""garage game development"" in 1992 in Zagreb, Croatia. From then on it has been continually involved in game development. Between 1993 and 1995 Croteam developed three games for different game platforms: Football Glory (PC, Amiga), 5-A-Side Soccer (Amiga) and Save the Earth (Amiga 4000). With the release of Football Glory, Croteam made a strong presence in the European market (mainly UK and Germany). In 1995 Croteam started to develop exclusively for the PC platform.  In 2001 Croteam finished two products: Serious Sam (a first-person shooter) and the Serious Engine (3D engine powering Serious Sam with Serious Tools: the Serious Editor and Serious Modeler). Serious Sam and the Serious Engine are two products that helped Croteam in establishing a presence in worldwide markets and creating different relationships with developers and publishers alike. In mid 2003, Croteam started development on Serious Sam II, which used their latest game engine at the time: Serious Engine 2. It allowed support for advanced refraction effects, high-resolution textures, high-dynamic range lighting, and light bloom effects. It was released in October 2005. Two years later development officially started on Serious Sam 3: BFE. In late 2009 and early 2010, HD remakes of The First Encounter and The Second Encounter were released via Steam, running on the superior Serious Engine 3, with updated models, textures, and 16-player co-op. Devolver Digital started a humorous advertisement campaign to promote their releases. In 2015, they founded an internal division named Croteam Incubator which produces and develops small-sized games.

Brian Goble is one of the co-founders along with Jason Hall. Many of the people involved with the formation of Monolith previously worked at Edmark Corporation. The company's first game was the first-person shooter Blood (1997), which was published by GT Interactive. By 1998, Monolith graduated to self-publishing status, releasing several games in various genres. The company then primarily focused on first-person shooters, such as No One Lives Forever series, Aliens Versus Predator 2 and others. While still developers at Edmark, Monolith's founders decided to enter into the fiercely competitive European 'demo' scene with a Windows-based programming showcase that demonstrated the kind of gaming graphics that, at the time, were believed possible only by using DOS. This demo caught the eye of Microsoft, with whom the Monolith founders worked on an early version of what eventually became the LithTech 3D engine. The company retained strong links with Microsoft for a long time, and was one of the first companies to incorporate Microsoft's API technology into a product, Shogo: Mobile Armor Division (1998).  In 2000, the company LithTech was established to handle development and sales for the engine. After the initial version, many enhanced versions of the engine were created: Lithtech Talon, Lithtech Jupiter and Lithtech Jupiter EX. That company was renamed Touchdown Entertainment in 2003. In 2004, Monolith was acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment Inc. There, the studio created the F.E.A.R. and Condemned series, as well as licensed games such as Gotham City Impostors (2012), Guardians of Middle-earth (2012), Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor (2014) and Middle-earth: Shadow of War (2017).

"n-Space, Inc.","n-Space, Inc. was an independent US-based development studio founded in 1994 by Erick S. Dyke and Dan O’Leary. It is based in Orlando, Florida (USA). The studio developed many titles based on popular licenses. Before n-Space, the three principals behind the establishment were employees of Martin Marietta’s Advanced Simulation Group who designed and developed 3D military simulators. They worked on Desert Tank (SEGA, Model2 Arcade, 1994) where they were responsible for key art and engineering, working along with Yu Suzuki. Until 2002 the studio initially focused on games for the Sony PlayStation with a few additional titles for the Windows platform. The PSX game RazorWing (1995) for SCEA was n-Space’s initial project and a playable version was shown in Sony's booth at E3 to favorable previews, although the project was later terminated three months short of completion. It featured technologies such as a high-res mode, streaming gaming areas from CD, and writing directly to the PlayStation graphics chips. The first official release was TigerShark (March 1997 - PSX/Windows) for GT Interactive. The Windows 95 version was the first full product to support MMX on the market, one of the first products to support Direct-Force and the code written by n-Space became part of Microsoft's official release. Sales were approximately 150k. Later that year, a second title was released: BugRiders: The Race of Kings (1997 - PSX/Windows) again for GT. This 3D race game placed the player on the back of giant insects. In 1998 a PSX console game based on the Duke Nukem franchise was developed: Duke Nukem: Time To Kill, again for GT. Sales were approximately 2 million units worldwide. The studio's next two games were based on the popular Rugrats license: Rugrats: Search for Reptar (1998) and Rugrats: Studio Tour. The first game sold about 5 million units worldwide and the sequel half of that. In 2000 the studio released no less than four titles. The first were Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas, and Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes as a sequel to Time to Kill. For the third title, Danger Girl, the team worked along with the original creators of the comic it was based on, J. Scott Campbell and Andy Hartnell. The last game for 2000 was the start of a new line of licensed adaptations: Mary-Kate and Ashley: Magical Mystery Mall. It was followed by Mary-Kate and Ashley: Crush Course in 2001. In 2002 n-Space moved on to new console platforms and created their first game for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube: Mary-Kate and Ashley: Sweet 16: Licensed to Drive. It was a Mario Party-like board game featuring the Olsen twins. No new titles were released until 2005 until the Nintendo DS version of GoldenEye: Rogue Agent. It was a quick work for hire project done in four months. During that time n-Space also created the DS version of their n-Gin technology. It was also the first Nintendo DS game to support 8-person play from a single card. Duke Nukem aside, the studio started to focus on more mature themes. After many years of licensed games the studio came with original IP with the game Geist (2005) for the GameCube. It took the team three years to complete the first-person title and they worked directly with the Nintendo legends Shigeru Miyamoto and Kensuke Tanabe. Approximately 300,000 units sold in the GameCube's twilight. In 2007 three more titles were released: Winx: Join the Club, their first PSP title, the Nintendo DS version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (250,000 in sales), and the DS adaptation of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (200,000 in sales). The work on the Call of Duty franchise was continued with the DS title Call of Duty: World at War (2008), and also Hue Pixel Painter. It was a companion title packed on the same cart as Tony Hawk's Motion. Hue was developed to use a unique accelerometer cartridge that plugs into the GBA slot. Players could tilt the DS to guide Hue as he attacks the evil Drabs while painting color back into the black-and-white fantasy world. In 2008 n-Space brought its first WiiWare title on the market: Target Toss Pro: Bags, as an adaptation of a popular arcade title about the backyard sport of ""cornhole"". Up to 16 players could compete in a variety of team and cutthroat modes. The year before, in 2007, the studio was working on the survival horror Title for the Wii. In 2009 however it was announced the game would never be fully developed. According to O’Leary: ""In almost every case we got hung up with the sales and marketing groups. They simply could not get behind a survival horror title on the Wii,"" [...] ""In spite of great sales for Resident Evil 4 and the Umbrella Chronicles, these groups were unable to support the projections required to create a viable [profit and loss statement] for the title."" [...] ""The idea of an 'adult' game on what they perceived to be a 'kids' console was simply too big a leap for them, regardless of the enthusiastic support of the PD department and the Wii's total domination in the marketplace"". In 2009 n-Space employed about 130 employees.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/e8b39034-bc7a-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1997,2015,United States

"Insomniac Games, Inc.","Insomniac Games is an independent game development studio based in Burbank, California (USA) and founded in 1994. Prior to starting Insomniac Games, CEO/President Ted Price spent a few years as controller of a start-up medical company. Together with the two programmers Alexander Hastings and Brian Hastings the studio's first title Disruptor was released in 1996. All of Insomniac Games’ titles from 1996 to 2012 have been developed exclusively for the PlayStation platforms, with franchises such as Ratchet & Clank, Resistance and the first three Spyro the Dragon games. Insomniac Games first received worldwide attention upon releasing Spyro the Dragon in 1998. Together with the follow-up titles Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage (1999) and Spyro: Year of the Dragon (2000), more than 12 million units were sold globally. In June 2008, the company announced plans to open a new studio in North Carolina by January 2009. In June 2011 Insomniac Click was revealed, a new division with a focus on web and mobile platforms. Even though Insomniac Games has always been independent, it had a close relationship with Sony working on Sony franchises exclusively as well as other studios close to Sony such as Naughty Dog, Sucker Punch, High Impact Games, Idol Minds, SCE Bend Studio, Nihilistic Software and others. They often shared technology and libraries and worked together on games. The last PlayStation-exclusive games for Sony were Resistance 3 and Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One, both released at the end of 2011. In an interview in February 2012 CEO Ted Price explained they moved away from Sony to work on new franchises and on multiple platforms. Both Ratchet & Clank and Resistance always remained the property of Sony. In May 2012 two new games were announced for Electronic Arts: the Facebook game Outernauts and the cooperative shooter Overstrike. A third new IP called Fuse was announced in September 2012, and eventually it became clear Fuse was a re-branding of the original Overstrike project. The game was released in May 2013.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/a584c39c-e3c3-11ef-9c54-02420a000165.webp,1996,2023,United States
"Kaneko Co., Ltd.","Kaneko was established in June 1980 by Hiroshi Kaneko as Kaneko Seisakusho Co., Ltd. in Nerima ward of Tokyo, Japan. The company was a bit player in both the arcade and home game spaces, working as a contract developer for Taito throughout the '80s. By 1990, they had started publishing their own titles, and established both a home development division (Inter State) and a US distribution division (Kaneko USA, which would also conduct its own development for a short period). In 1996, Kaneko introduced the Kaneko Super Nova System, a cartridge-based arcade platform similar to SNK's Neo Geo system. However, the system was not the success Kaneko had hoped for, and by the turn of the century the company's game output had stopped. By this point, the company was mostly known for its softcore-porn Gals Panic franchise. Legal troubles, including a lawsuit against Hitachi over the Nova System, led the company to declare bankruptcy in 2004, and to finally close for good following a civil lawsuit in 2006.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/f942071a-bc79-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1982,2002,Japan

Zombie Studios Inc.,"Zombie Studios Inc. (formerly known as Zombie Inc. since circa 1999 and before that Zombie LLC) is a game development studio based in Seattle, United States. It was founded in 1994 by Mark Long and Joanna Alexander. They both came from the Sarnoff Research Center where they made a virtual reality game for Hasbro in 1993. The company used its experience with virtual reality products in different areas. It designed and developed a motion-based, real-time, 3D ride for the new DisneyQuest center in Orlando, Florida, and produced a music video.  In 2008, Zombie branched out into comics with Shrapnel, an epic solar war trilogy published by Radical Publishing and in 2009 announced its first feature film Blacklight, produced by Fox Atomic. Both will be adapted to games as well. The company also focuses on military simulators for the American army, including Virtual Army Experience, AH-64D Apache Simulator, Future Soldier Trainer, Convoy Trainer, Future Force Company Commander  and more. In its line of games entertainment, a focus on military themes is also persistent. The company also created a series of Internet portals, called ""The CentralHQ Network,"" designed to serve the specific needs of members of the U.S. military and their families. The network's properties included all branches of the military, combining free email/fax/voice messaging; online banking and bill paying services; and customizable and military-tailored content. It was designed to serve as the home page for the approximately 2.8 million military households that are online. The studio also contributed to the US military-sponsored title America's Army 3 (2009). On 7th February 2000 AIS (Advanced Interactive Systems), a company that creates high-tech, interactive computer simulation training and entertainment systems acquired the company along with The CentralHQ Network. Long and Alexander remained in charge of the subsidiary and also became Vice Presidents of AIS. The current status of the company is not clear, as the website once again lists Zombie Studios as an independent company. The studio has a long history in game development spanning many platforms. In 1995 Zombie LLC was involved with three titles. It produced the spaceship simulator Ice & Fire developed by AnimaTek. In the same year Zombie developed the racing game Locus and ported Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure to the SEGA 32X together with Big Bang Software. In 1996, Zombie released Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands, an instalment in the long-running Zork series, but the involvement is likely to have been small, as the credits exclusively list developers from Activision. The company was much more involved with its own first-person shooter ZPC, released in the same year. In 1998 Zombie released games in two new franchises. The first was the tank simulation combat title Spearhead and the second was the launch of the first-person shooter Spec Op series, with the base game Spec Ops: Rangers Lead the Way and the expansion Spec Ops: Ranger Team Bravo both released in the same year. It was continued with a sequel in 1999: Spec Ops II: Green Berets, the first game after the incorporation of the company. After that, many more games in the series were released, but no longer developed by Zombie itself except for the Dreamcast game Spec Ops II: Omega Squad in 2000 (together with Runecraft). The follow-up titles include Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol (2000), Spec Ops: Ranger Elite (2000) and Spec Ops: Covert Assault (2001). All three were created by Runecraft, a company the studio would cooperate with often. The Zombie team assisted during the development. The final game in the series was Spec Ops: Airborne Commando, developed by Big Grub and released in 2002. In 1999, the studio also released the spear fishing simulator Body Glove's Bluewater Hunter and in 2000 the team provided art to the Cover Ops encyclopaedia Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Covert Ops Essentials, working together with Magic Lantern and the main series' development studio Red Storm Entertainment. In 2001, following the acquisition of the company by AIS, Zombie focused on entirely new themes, with the first-person prison escape game Alcatraz: Prison Escape and two titles based on Disney's animated movie Atlantis: Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire - Search for the Journal and Disneys' Atlantis: The Lost Empire - Trial by Fire. The studio continued with movie licensees, working on adaptation of the action movie Ecks vs. Sever for the PlayStation 2, but it was eventually cancelled. Instead, it returned to the military genre, assisting NovaLogic with development on Delta Force: Task Force Dagger (2002), the standalone mission pack to Delta Force: Land Warrior. Mark Long spearheaded the deal to create the game Super Bubble Pop (2002) based on the Super Bubble Pop sweet styling gum line of Vain International. Development was eventually handled by its trusty partner Runecraft. The company returned to full development on familiar terrain with the release of the military shooter Shadow Ops: Red Mercury in 2004. It was the studio's first Xbox title (next to a Windows version) and the first time Zombie worked with the UnrealEngine 3D game engine. After that, game releases became less frequent. The studio created Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Way of the Warrior for the Plug and Play CMOS Camera Video Game, but another major title took until October 2009 when Saw was released, based on the popular horror movie series. Part of the delay is likely to have been caused by the closing of Brash Entertainment, the original publisher, and by the involvement of the new publisher Konami to introduce slights changes to the game. The seemingly long lull in releases was also caused by a deal with Bethesda Softworks that fell through.  In the Fall of 2006, Rogue Warrior: Black Razor was announced, a tactical first-person shooter set in modern day Korea to be released in 2007. After a long silence, the game resurfaced in 2009 as Rogue Warrior with Rebellion as the development team. Bethesda stated publicly that it was not satisfied by the way Zombie originally took the game. A third reason was the establishment of Direct Action Games, a value label to design and produce titles for both PC and consoles. Between 2005 and 2006, four military-themed games were released by the Zombie team operating under a different name: Combat: Task Force 121, World War II Combat: Road to Berlin, World War II Combat: Iwo Jima and Close Quarters Conflict. Currently Zombie Studios develops games for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 powered by the UnrealEngine3 game engine. In July 2010 Blacklight: Tango Down was released for XBLA and Windows, about a covert ops team in a dystopian future battle for peace and security. Zombie is currently working on Shrapnel, an adaptation of the company's own comic book series.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/0b5e546c-bc7f-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1995,2014,United States

"Three-Sixty Pacific, Inc.","Three-Sixty Pacific was founded in late 1980's by avid wargamers and military history enthusiasts. Their games, although by no means selling like hot cakes, were always thoughtfully designed, with a high level of realism rarely seen in wargames, user-friendly mouse-driven interface, clean graphics, and excellent tutorial and on-line help files. While fellow wargaming houses such as QQP and SSI diversifies into non-historical and hypothetical wargames, Three-Sixty stuck to their first love: historical wargames, for all in-house efforts. After some diversification efforts in the late 80's - early 90's when the company published several action games, Three-Sixty developed and published Harpoon - a masterpiece based on Larry Bond's tabletop wargame that was inducted into Computer Gaming 150 Best Games of All Time and is still regarded today as THE best naval simulation ever produced. Despite the considerable commercial success of Harpoon and Atomic Games' V for Victory Series, complete failure of lavishly-produced but esoteric Theatre of War and lack of funds brought the company to its knees in early 1994.

"Tradewest, Inc.","Tradewest was founded in 1986 by John Rowe (former Executive Vice President, SNK Corp, Japan's U.S. subsidiary), Leland Cook (banker and rancher) and his son Byron Cook. Tradewest started out by manufacturing SNK's Ikari Warriors arcade game in the United States. This would be one of the few arcade games to be released by Tradewest (along with Victory Road, Alpha Mission and Redline Racer) as the company would shift away from the coin-op business to concentrate on video games for home consoles. In 1987, Tradewest purchased Cinematronics Inc. of El Cajon, California and renamed it The Leland Corporation. John Rowe was chosen to run the El Cajon office. Tradewest was acquired by WMS Industries (the owners of the Williams and Midway brands) in 1994, and renamed Williams Entertainment, Inc., thus signalling the end of Tradewest as a company. Williams Entertainment became WMS's home console division. In 1996, WMS was losing interest in video games and, as such, Williams Entertainment was transferred to Midway who renamed the division Midway Home Entertainment, Inc. Like was the case with WMS, the division served as Midway's foothold to the home console market, which could now develop and publish video games in-house without having to rely on other publishers. Both the Corsicana, Texas, and a new R&D facility in San Diego remained opened within Midway and continued to employ Byron Cook (who became president of Midway Home Entertainment) and John Rowe (who became Vice-Chairman and Director of Product Development) developing and publishing games for Nintendo, Microsoft X Box, Sony Playstation and the PC. Both Byron Cook and John Rowe left Midway in 2001. Some of the many award winning games developed and published by Tradewest and Midway Games includes, Ikari Warriors, John Elway's Quarterback, Magic Johnson's Fastbreak, Super Off-Road, Battletoads, Double Dragon, Mortal Kombat, NFL Blitz, NBA Showtime, Doom 64, Cruisin USA, Ready to Rumble and Hydro Thunder. In 2009 the company came in the picture again when Spiess Media Holding, the company of Midway's former international executive vice president, announced to have acquired the brand. Since the main Midway company had run into trouble and filed for bankruptcy in February 2009, Spiess Media Holding bought out the French and UK office Midway Games SAS and Midway Games Ltd. (completed on 20th August 2009) and rebranded them the day after using the Tradewest name, as Tradewest Games SAS and Tradewest Games Ltd. respectively.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/ddfe065e-ab6a-11ed-be6f-02420a000197.webp,1985,2012,United States

"High Moon Studios, Inc.","High Moon Studios is a game development studio based in Carlsbad, San Diego, California (USA). It is owned by Activision Blizzard as a wholly owned subsidiary. The company was established in Century City, California as Sammy Entertainment, Inc. in April 2001 as a subsidiary of Sammy USA Corporation. In 2002 the name was changed to Sammy Studio, Inc. and the company moved to San Diego. In this period the company name was also used as the publisher for many localized Japanese titles. The company became independent in March 2005 when Chief Operating Officer John Rowe bought the company from Sammy Corporation. The name was then changed to High Moon Studios. The studio debuted in 2005 with the first-person shooter Darkwatch. In January 2006 the company lost its independent status again when it was acquired by Vivendi Universal Games. In December 2007 a merger between Vivendi and Activision was announced and that way it became an Activision subsidiary. Following the merger about 60 of the 150 developers were laid off. The company has solely focused on action games. Following Darkwatch (2005), the studio only created titles based on existing licenses: Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy (2008), two Transformers games: Transformers: War for Cybertron (2010) and Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, and most recently Deadpool (2013).

Halfbrick Studios Pty Ltd,"Halfbrick is a game development studio based in Queensland, Australia. It was established in 2001 and is led by Shainiel Deo who is also one of the original founders. From 2002 to 2008 the company mainly did contract work for other Australian developers. Their work on these games is often uncredited. The global financial crisis of 2007 changed Halfbrick's activities. In the first years there were always new contracts, but from then on their pitches did not lead to any new projects. The company's survival was because of the Halfbrick Fridays initiative. Every second Friday, Halfbrick’s employees got together and prototype new ideas. This made the company come to the foreground with its own IP and projects. The game Raskulls was already in development then, but the prototyping sessions led to the creation of smaller games such as Echoes, Aero Racer, Blast Off and Age of Zombies. The company's biggest success is the Fruit Ninja series.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/64a50cde-74fe-11f0-bf3e-02420a000181.webp,2006,2024,Australia

"Presage Software, Inc.","Presage Software began business in 1986 in San Rafael, California, as a developer of software. During the decade that followed, the company gained expertise in all aspects of multimedia offering development, concept design, marketing and quality assurance testing. In addition, the company outsourced its team's talents in graphics and sound design to many of the big named companies of that era. Possibly the company's most lucrative event took place in 1993 when they purchased the rights to Lode Runner. The games that followed were well received and profitable for the company. One of the divisions within Presage was Stepping Stone which was responsible for the development of edutainment titles, one of which was Chess Mates, the 30th title developed by Presage since its inception. The Presage Cross Platform Development System enabled them to efficiently develop products for DOS, Windows and Macintosh with shared resources. It was this and other proprietary technology that became attractive to other companies, and in 1999 Human Code, Inc. of Austin, Texas, acquired the company. It became the west coast studio for Human Code in San Rafael, California, and was named Presage Studio.

"Toaplan Co., Ltd.","Toaplan Co., Ltd. (株式会社東亜プラン) was a Japanese game development company headquartered in Suginami-ku, Tokyo, with their development office in Toshima-ku, Tokyo. The company was established in 1984 as the development division of arcade distributor Toa Kikaku, and was best known for their manic arcade shoot-'em-ups such as Truxton, Zero Wing, and Batsugun. The studio's origins trace back to Shinjuku-based Orca, where much of the early Toaplan team met. Following Orca's bankruptcy in 1984, the development team established Crux. However, Crux itself soon faced bankruptcy, and the team again moved to Toa Kikaku, establishing their development division, Toaplan. After a few minor releases, Toaplan's first big hit was Tiger-Heli, which was also the start of a long relationship with Taito, who distributed the game. This was followed up with a number of shooters, including Slap Fight, Sky Shark, and Twin Cobra. With the release of Hellfire in 1989, Toaplan had enough clout to begin releasing and distributing their arcade titles under their own name, and would soon after begin making forays into console development and publishing as well. The company also experimented in genres other than shooters, with titles like Wardner, Snow Brothers, and Knuckle Bash. With shooters, particularly the high-difficulty, high-intensity titles Toaplan was famous for, waning in popularity by the mid-'90s, the company was hit hard financially and was forced to close in 1994. Former Toaplan staffers went on to establish a number of other studios, including CAVE, Takumi, Tamsoft, and Gazelle, while others found their way to other prestigious studios including Square and Taito. Many of these studios continued and built on Toaplan's history of manic shooting games.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/46bb870c-ab6b-11ed-8048-02420a000198.webp,1985,2024,Japan

"Gaelco, S.A.","Gaelco, S.A., the trading name of Gabinete Electrónico Consultivo, S.A., was a game studio based in Barcelona, Spain. It was founded in October 1985 by Josep Quinglés, Luis Jonama and Javier Valero. The company started in electronics with a coin-operated car Coche Fantástico for kids for the company Falgás. The studio's first game was the Arcade trivia title Master Boy, first announced in June 1986 and released in 1987. Entirely text-based, it was later remade with graphics with the same title Master Boy in 1991. The company then started to complement their technological knowledge with creative elements, when people like Toni López Yeste and Xavi Arrebola G. joined in 1988 and 1989 respectively, to form a team of programmers, designers, artists and musicians. This led to the studio's release of Big Karnak in 1991 as a first fully realized game. The company also actively recruited new talent such as Xavier Fradera from the Escola de Cómic Joso in Barcelona. Gaelco was known to design its own hardware and software internally. They published several games by other Spanish developers, handling the hardware side and the cabinet. From 1996 onwards the company moved away from standard standing cabinets to full body motion experiences such as a rally cockpit, motorcycle, quad, luge board and even football games where a real football needs to be kicked to pass and shoot. The studio released a second Arcade action platformer Thunder Hoop in 1992, the first project where designer Xavier Fradera was involved with after joining in October 1991. It received a sequel TH Strikes Back in 1994. In 1993 Gaelco launched the Arcade racer World Rally Championship developed by Zigurat Software S.L. to international acclaim, and a sequel World Rally 2: Twin Racing was released in 1995. The company would release two more 2D titles before transitioning to 3D: Alligator Hunt (1994) and Biomechanical Toy (1995 - designed by Zeus Software). In the world of 3D the studio rivalled Arcade stars Namco and SEGA. They released the Ridge Racer-inspired racing game Speed Up in 1996 and their Radikal Bikers (1998) provided the inspiration for SEGA's Crazy Taxi series. With a PlayStation port Radikal Bikers was also the first home version of a Gaelco game, courtesy of Bit Managers. The arcade racing gameplay was continued in ROLLing eX.tre.me (1999), Smashing Drive (2000), ATV Track (2002), Tokyo Cop: Special Police Reinforcement (2003) and Ring Riders (2004). The studio's last Arcade title was Gaelco Tuning Race Championship (2005). Namco was closely involved, publishing and distributing its titles in the USA. Other early titles by Gaelco are Xor World (prototype - unreleased), Splash! (1992 - developed by OMK), Squash (1992), Glass (1993 - developed by OMK), Target Hits (1994 - developed by Zigurat Software), Last KM (1995 - an unreleased 2D side-scrolling cycling game with Giorgio Moroder's  The Chase as an unlicensed soundtrack - developed by Zeus Software. In 2017 the board was donated by the original programmer to be dumped for Arcade emulation), Touch and Go (1995), Maniac Square (1996, based on a 1992 prototype), Snow Board Championship (1996 - developed by OMK), Surf Planet (1997 - developed by Zigurat Software), Bang! (1998 - developed by Bit Managers), Football Power (2000 - developed by Zigurat Software) and Gaelco Football (2002 - developed by Zigurat Software). In the nineties they worked on the untitled concept of an action puzzle game inspired by Tetris with complex mathematical deduction, but it was never completed. The company was also involved with the fitness machines Salter Cardioline Pro Cycle (1997) and Salter Cardioline Pro Stepper (1998) developed by OMK on behalf of Salter. In 1998 Gaelco attempted to break further into the console market through the acquisition of the studio Bit Managers they previously worked with, but they were used to handling every aspect of the process themselves and couldn't adapt to the technology owners and publishers in the console market, so they did not pursue it further. They sold the company back to the original owner in 2001. In 2005 the development of new titles was no longer sustainable due to new consumer habits, saturation in certain genres and the growing popularity of consoles. This took the studio in different directions with three separate and independent companies. A part of the studio moved on to PC titles. Following the success of Football Power and Gaelco Football they picked up creating games for the PC Fútbol series that was started by Dinamic Software in 1992 with titles such as PC Fútbol 2005, PC Fútbol 2006 and PC Fútbol 2007, as well as Controcampo 2006: il videogioco (2006). After 2007 no further games were released and the company started to develop electronic dart machines under the name of Gaelco Darts as another part of the studio had remained with its Arcade origins, for instance developing the electronic darts machine Radikal Darts (2005). Finally the Gaelco name also lived on in the studio Gaelco Móviles S.L. based in Madrid and established in October 2001. It was a partnership between Gaelco and Zigurat Software led by Pere Torrents. Gaelco Móviles developed games internally, but also acted as a publisher and distributor of games by other developers such as Abylight, S.L. using the TopGam label. Gaelco Móviles was acquired by Player X in July 2008.

Petroglyph Games Inc.,"Petroglyph Games Inc. is a video game development studio based in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. The company was formed by a group of former Westwood Studios employees who had resigned when Electronic Arts merged Westwood Studios into EA Los Angeles in 2003. Other former Westwood employees initially accepted EA's relocation offer, but eventually returned to Las Vegas to work with Petroglyph. Coincidentally, the old Westwood Studios building is not that far away from the current Petroglyph building. Petroglyph is primarily known for their strong experience in RTS game development. The company's founding members have worked on seminal and influential games in the genre, most notably Command & Conquer and Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty, which affected Petroglyph's focus on strategy games. After announcing a partnership with the publishing studio True Games Interactive in April 2008, the action RPG title Mytheon was revealed in December of the same year, ultimately releasing in 2015. As its own company, Petroglyph is best known for Star Wars: Empire at War, Universe at War: Earth Assault, Grey Goo, the 8-Bit Armies series and Command & Conquer: Remastered Collection.

RedLynx Ltd,"RedLynx is a game development studio based in Helsinki, Finland and it is owned by Ubisoft. The origins date back to around 1997 when the brothers Atte Ilvessuo and Antti Ilvessuo established the independent game development studio Wah-Software. They created four games, both freeware and shareware, as well as a 3D engine, and Atte also joined Housemarque in 2000 for a part time job. In September 2000 Wah-Software announced a change of company structure and in November 2000 a separate studio Red Lynx Laboratories Ltd. was announced. It was officially established in August 2000. The variation Redlynx Laboratories Ltd was also used and the name was changed to RedLynx Ltd. in 2004. Red Lynx Laboratories would be used for all commercial projects, while Wah-Software would be maintained for freeware games. No more Wah-Software games were released however and most likely around 2002 the studio disappeared. Atte had the role of CEO and lead programmer, while Antti worked as art director and IT specialist. They were soon joined by 3D animator Saku Jalkanen from Zero Gravity Productions. The studio developed its own 3D engine called Theatre Engine. Early JAVA games by the company are Micro Rowing (2000), Micro Fill-it (2000), Micro CaveQuest (2000), Micro Boxing (2000), Micro Basketball (2000), Basket2 (2000), Hunters' Club (2001) along with RollerCoaster and SkyFliing. Possibly the company initially worked together with Axentor Solutions for JAVA titles, a partnership announced when they still operated as Wah-Software. One of its first JAVA games that would later become the company's most important franchise was the stunt bike game Trials (2000). Other projects are the browser games Moominpappa Goes Fishing! and Kimi Burning (2002) based on the F1 racer Kimi Räikkönen, and the TV SMS game Katapultti (Catapult - 2001). The sequel Catapult II was released in 2004. In 2002 two more TV SMS games for the Finnish TV channel SUBTV were launched as Bumber Cars (2002), a 3D game with cars that can be driven and crash into each other using SMS messages, and Astronaut 1: Earth Defender (2002), where Earth needs to be saved against invaders by launching astronauts through coordinates using SMS messages. The latter was also licensed to TV channels worldwide and in December 2002 the company made the complimentary Symbian game Astronaut along with the sequel Astronaut 2: Intergalactic Missions launched in November. At the end of 2002 the company contributed to the charity TV show Tahti Lapselle - A Star to a Child that collected funds for the Children's department of Lapland's central hospital in Finland. They created an application where Christmas greetings could be sent and were show on TV with an animation. This application too would in later years be licensed to many TV stations worldwide. The studio continued its Wah-Software legacy of the Alien Phobia series with the release in 2002 of the third and final game in the series, the freeware title Phobia III. Red Lynx also contributed to the marketing campaign with animations and art of the mobile game Botfighters (2001) by It's Alive Mobile Games AB and they created animations for the first Assembly demo party event held in August 2001 in Helsinki, Finland as well as animations for TV (commercials). At the end of 2001 and early 2002 the studio created titles such as the browser downhill sledding game Pulkkamäki (Sled Slide - 2002), the skiing game DNA Spin (2002) and Cartoon Fishing (2002). Most of these projects were commissioned. New games launched in 2003 include Mountains of Pharao, Bean-Stalk, Dodgeball, Formula Racing, Gold Rush, RallyX and Bulldozer. In that year the studio also revamped one of its earliest titles Trials for the first time as Trial Bike Basic followed by the sequel Trial Bike Pro. The year 2004 was an important one for the company. By then the studio employed about 40 people, moved to a new premise in Helsinki, changed its name to RedLynx Ltd. and presented itself as an AAA developer. The CEO of the company was Tero Virtala. Games released in 2004 include Penalty Soccer, Misse & Murre in Space, Splash! and the TV game Dance Shakedown. On 13th September the company announced it would develop games exclusive for Nokia's new N-Gage phone/handheld. A first title Pathway to Glory was released in November and the sequel Pathway to Glory: Ikusa Islands in 2005. In the same year they also completed the turn-based N-Gage game High Seize. Meanwhile RedLynx continued its broad activities in 2005 with two browser games, another entry in the Trials series called Trials Construction Yard, and the rollercoaster management game Fantasy Rollercoaster. They also created the TV games Be a Rap Star for a live TV show where lyrics to beats were sent using text messages, Hockey as a hockey match played against a TV host, animated characters called The Talking Heads for a TV chat show, and the TV show SchoolDay. The studio also launched the website FooGamers to play web based physics games. In February 2006 the venture capital company 3i acquired a 12.5% stake in the company. In that year the company mainly focused on TV games with the interactive mind games Sudoku, WordCoiner, Minesweeper, WordSplinter and WordCoiner Final, as well as the football competition TV show Voittopotku. In 2007 the company launched the dating service 247avec and returned to major game development. Even though its three N-Gage games were received favorably, the N-Gage platform lacked popularity. Its next title Warhammer 40,000: Squad Command was developed for PSP and Nintendo DS and launched in November 2007. It was met with mediocre reviews. RedLynx launched another game in the same month: RedLynx Trials 2: Second Edition, a new version of its long-running series. Launched on Windows with a limited web based version, it would become a worldwide success and there were updates the year after that expanded the content significantly. In 2008 three more games were released: Reset Generation (N-Gage / browser / J2ME) with cross-platform multiplayer, Scrabble (J2ME) and Monster Trucks Nitro (PC). In 2009 three titles were released, the iOS games DrawRace and Monster Trucks Nitro II, and an Xbox 360 version of Trials 2 as Trials HD. Just like the PC version a lot of content was added afterwards through DLC and by May 2011 sales exceeded two million units. The success was celebrated in 2010 with the release of the game Trials Legends, offered for free to all Facebook fans of the series. It was created to capture the Trials experience of the first games in the series released between 2000 and 2005. Also in 2010 the Symbian location based top-down racing game Ovi Maps Racing was released. In 2011 1000 Heroz (iOS), DrawRace 2 (iOS / Android) and MotoHeroz (WiiWare) were released. In November of that year the company was acquired by Ubisoft. From then on the focus was entirely on game development. In 2012 RedLynx released a new Trials game called Trials Evolution (Xbox 360) and the iOS game Nutty Fluffies Rollercoaster with an Android release in 2013. In 2013 the Xbox 360 Trials sequel was also released for the PC as Trials Evolution: Gold Edition. In 2014 the fifth game in the series Trials Fusion (Xbox 360 / Xbox One / PlayStation 4 / PC) was released as well as a free-to-play Trials Frontier adaptation for mobile devices. Recent releases include Trials of the Blood Dragon (2016), South Park: Phone Destroyer (2017) and Trials Rising (2019).",https://cdn.mobygames.com/c880f4ee-bc81-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,2001,2024,Finland

"Naughty Dog, Inc.","Naughty Dog was founded in 1984 by the then-sixteen-year-old Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin. In their own words, they ""needed money to buy video games and stuff"", so they ""worked hard, and that's the whole story"". The company started as JAM software The first game it sold was Ski Crazed for Apple II. Jam Software also created Dream Zone (1988), a graphic adventure that was one of the first ones to support the PC's VGA graphics standard. Both of these early games were published by Baudville. Things really got going when Jam Software signed on with Electronic Arts and began producing Keef the Thief for the Apple IIGS, Amiga, Atari ST, and PC. Contemporaneously, the team changed its name to Naughty Dog (as the founders state, ""nobody remembers exactly why we chose the name"").  In 1992 Naughty Dog published Rings of Power, one of EA's first three Genesis projects. Gavin went on to Boston's MIT to pursue a degree in Artificial Intelligence, and Rubin went to Newport Beach, California, to learn surfing and 3D computer graphics. Rubin wishes now that he had done more surfing -- within a year Naughty Dog reformed in Boston and created Way of the Warrior for the 3DO. The project was self-financed. Searching for a publisher, Naughty Dog met Universal Interactive Studios. UIS published the game in 1994. Naughty Dog signed a three project deal with UIS, moved to LA, and began work on a new project. With a proper budget for further game development, the company hired new employees, starting with Dave Baggett, one of Gavin’s fellow AI students from MIT, and others. They also acquired Silicon Graphics workstations. It took two years, 16-18 hours a day, to create the first Crash Bandicoot. Due to a “quirk” in the PlayStation developers contract, Naughty Dog managed to keep the game secret until just before E3, 1996. At that point, Sony insisted that they see the game.  The public first saw Crash Bandicoot at E3 in May of 1996, favorably comparing it to Mario games. In January 2001 Naughty Dog, Inc. was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment America. It is now part of the SCE Worldwide Studios group.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/b473f5ee-a999-11ef-9bdd-02420a000166.webp,1987,2024,United States
"Neversoft Entertainment, Inc.","Neversoft Entertainment Inc. was founded in July 1994 by gaming veterans Joel Jewett, Mick West and Chris Ward, and was based in Los Angeles, California. The three founders were previously with Malibu Interactive until they felt the company would go under, which happened as it closed down the same year. They had already left and established their own studio. The company struggled the first three years, spending too much times on commissioned games that were later cancelled, despite their strict work regime. During those years the studio only released Skeleton Warriors (1996). By Christmas 1997, they could only pay half a paycheck, after that it was a quarter. Before going under the company finally got a big break when Activision hired them in January 1998 to develop a game using the voice of Bruce Willis. That project became Apocalypse and it was released in November 1998. Impressed with the progress, Activision asked Neversoft in May 1998 to start work on a skateboarding game. They managed to get the endorsement of Tony Hawk and the skateboarding project became Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. At the same time, in October 1999, Activision acquired the company and all members of the studio's management team signed long-term employment contracts. The game became a smashing hit and would become the company's most important franchise under the name Tony Hawk skateboarding series. It was followed by many sequels that managed to rack up $1 billion in sales over the years. Over the years the studio also worked on other titles such as the PlayStation port of MDK (1998), Spider-Man (2000) and the western shooter GUN (2005). In 2006 Activision acquired RedOctane and its Guitar Hero franchise, but the development studio Harmonix Music Systems behind the series was acquired by MTV, leaving Activision with no development team for the game. Neversoft took over development on Guitar Hero starting with Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock (2007), followed by Guitar Hero: Aerosmith (2008) and Guitar Hero: World Tour. The studio's last skateboarding title was Tony Hawk's Proving Ground (2007), which managed to innovate less than the skate series by Electronic Arts. In January 2009 co-founder Joel Jewett said in an interview the franchise was handed to a different development studio, and that Neversoft would focus on new titles in the Guitar Hero series. In May 2014, it was announced Neversoft and Infinity Ward would merge into a single Infinity Ward studio headed by Dave Stohl, retiring the Neversoft name. Neversoft studio head Joel Jewett and studio director Scott Pease retired from games after the transition. The studio was finally disbanded on 11 July 2014.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/147784c6-bc82-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1996,2025,United States

tri-Ace Inc.,"Tri-Ace was founded by Yoshiharu Gotanda, Masaki Norimoto and Joe Asanuma in 1995. These three were the Three Aces from Wolf Team. Joe Asanuma protested because Asanuma was the director and head of Wolf Team but they brought in Eiji Kikuchi to direct the game Tales of Phantasia. Meanwhile, Yoshiharu Gotanda and Masaki Norimoto were protesting how Namco marketed the game ""Tale Phantasia"" (Namco changed its name to Tales of Phantasia, took the copyright and the trademark, etc.) that Gotanda wrote and totally programmed and Norimoto designed. These protests pushed the game's release back by almost a year. Many other development staff members involved with Wolf Team also left and participated in the founding of Tri-Ace, such as: Yoshiaki Inagaki, Hiroya Hatsushiba, Motoi Sakuraba, Kenichi Kanekura, Shigeru Ueki and Mari Kimura.  Initially the company was headed by Joe Asanuma, but he left in 1998 to pursue other interests and Yoshiharu Gotanda took over the position.  The company has been financed by Enix since it began its operations. This did not change with the merger of Square and Enix into Square Enix.

Sensible Software,"Founded in Chelmsford, Essex, UK in 1986 by Jon Hare and Chris Yates, two former school friends, Sensible Software was one of the most successful European development teams throughout the 8 Bit and 16-Bit eras, creating no less than seven #1 games in the UK in their 13 year history and scooping many industry awards in the process. Well regarded as eccentric mavericks, the team produced some strange and original games over the years. They later moved their offices to the Cambridgeshire town of March before settling in Saffron Walden, Essex in 1993. Sensible Software enjoyed their greatest run of success between 1991 and 1995, with hits such as the Sensible Soccer games including Sensible World of Soccer, the Cannon Fodder games and Mega lo Mania. They were well known for their humorous small characters, quirky pop video intros and clean, precise and imaginative gameplay. However although they became masters of the 2D graphics machines, their transition into the 3D era was less successful and after spending considerable time and effort on their ground breaking game Sex 'n' Drugs 'n' Rock 'n' Roll (which they initially signed to Warner Interactive Entertainment), they found the very risqué game too near the knuckle for Warner's purchaser's GT Software and were subsequently unable to sell it on to any publishers in the pre-GTA days of 1998. In 1999 Jon and Chris sold Sensible Software to Codemasters, one of the top games publishers in the UK, for an undisclosed sum. Subsequent to Codemasters purchase of Sensible Software in 1999 Jon Hare has designed many games for Codemasters including various versions of Sensibler Soccer and Cannon Fodder.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/46132b38-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1986,1997,

Starbreeze Studios AB,"Starbreeze Studios AB is a Sweden-based games development studio founded in 1999. The company develops computer and television games on pre-financed assignments from major game publishers. The publisher usually owns the rights to the production and carries the financial risk. If a game does well in the marketplace Starbreeze obtains additional sales-royalties after the pre-finance amount has been covered for the publisher. In 2001 the company merged into O3 Games as their games development and R&D department. In November, the parent company was renamed Starbreeze AB, of which Starbreeze Studios AB is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. The company released its first game, Enclave (Windows/Xbox) in 2002, followed by Knights of the Temple: Infernal Crusade (Xbox/PS2/GameCube/Windows) in 2004, along with the movie-licensed The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay (Windows/Xbox) in 2004. The company's first two games received favourable reviews, but it was the acclaim for the Riddick first-person shooter that really established Starbreeze Studios internationally. The company's next game, The Darkness (Xbox 360/PS3), was another first-person shooter and is based on a comic book license. Released in 2007, it is the only Starbreeze game not to be released on the Windows platform. In 2009 the studio returned to the Riddick license with the sequel The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena developed together with Tigon Studios and in 2012 they released another first-person shooter, Syndicate, for Electronic Arts, as a reboot of the Bullfrog series from the nineties. It was the last game of the company developed using an in-house engine, as they signed with Epic Games in February 2011 to use the UnrealEngine for all future projects. In 2009 seven members left the company to found the development studio MachineGames Sweden AB. It was partly prompted by the rough development process of Syndicate, as the project went through several overhauls before it was released. In April 2012 the company announced to acquire the Swedish studio SLG Everscreen AB (better known as Overkill Software). The transaction was completed on 21st June 2012 when Starbreeze acquired all shares from Varvtre AB. Through the acquisition, Varvtre raised its stake in Starbreeze from zero to 200 million shares (14,5%). On 9th February 2013 the name of the acquired studio was officially changed to Starbreeze Production AB, but it still refers to itself publicly as Overkill Software.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/856fb3f6-bc78-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1997,2024,Sweden

Cinemaware Corporation,"Cinemaware Corporation was founded in 1985. The company was Robert Jacob's and Phyllis Jacob's software development house. Established in 1985, it existed for seven years before going under in 1991. Cinemaware was responsible for creating games that, true to their name, were almost of a movie-like quality, or at least a reasonable facsimile, given the technology of the time. The company was an active developer of award-winning games on the Amiga, C64, Apple IIGS, PC, NES, NEC Turbografx and other computers and console systems. In the early 1990's NEC asked Cinemaware to do a CD-enhanced remake of It Came from the Desert for its TurboGrafx CD console, in exchange for buying 20 percent of the company. Cinemaware sank $700,000 in the project, almost five times as much as a regular budget at the time. The movie-like production skills drained the funds quickly and the company went under in 1991, before the game was finished. Under the leadership of David Riordan the game was completed on a tight budget and released in 1992. Many of Cinemaware's original programmers, designers, artists, and producers left to work for top developers and publishers around the industry, such as Microsoft, Cavedog Entertainment, Disney Interactive and Electronic Arts. In 2000 a new company called Cinemaware, Inc. was formed based on the name and assets of the original Cinemaware.

"Fictions, Inc.","Fictions, Inc. (formerly Private Division) is an American video game publisher based in Los Angeles, California. The company was originally established in December 2017 as a publishing label of Take-Two Interactive, intended to support small to mid-sized independent studios developing so-called ""triple-I"" titles, games positioned between large-scale AAA productions and smaller indie projects. During its time as Private Division, the label published and funded several acclaimed independent titles, including The Outer Worlds by Obsidian Entertainment, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey by Panache Digital Games, Disintegration by V1 Interactive, OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome by Roll7, and managed publishing for Kerbal Space Program and its sequel. The label also signed partnerships with studios such as Moon Studios, Evening Star, Piccolo Studio, Die Gute Fabrik, Yellow Brick Games, and Wētā Workshop. In November 2024, Take-Two Interactive sold Private Division to Texas-based equity firm Haveli Investments as part of a strategic shift to focus on AAA and mobile titles. Following the acquisition, most of Private Division’s staff were laid off, and its studios Roll7 and Intercept Games were closed. In early 2025, reports surfaced that Haveli Investments had brought in former Annapurna Interactive employees—many of whom had departed that company in late 2024—to lead and restructure the publisher. By mid-2025, the label was officially rebranded as Fictions, Inc., marking a new chapter for the company under its new leadership. The transition coincided with the reveal of LEGO Party and the continuation of publishing Beast of Reincarnation, a title developed by Game Freak (originally announced under Private Division as Project Bloom).",https://cdn.mobygames.com/acfff332-a748-11f0-8918-02420a00017b.webp,2018,2025,United States

Guerrilla B.V.,"Guerrilla Games is a Dutch game development studio and a first party developer for Sony. It is based in Amsterdam and is part of PlayStation Studios. It is best known for the Horizon and Killzone franchises. The company was established on 1st January 2000 as Lost Boys Games as a subsidiary of multimedia conglomerate company Lost Boys owned by Michiel Mol and as the result of a merger between three studios: Orange Games, Digital Infinity, and Formula Game Development. It was initially led by Martin de Ronde who previously led Formula Game Development and sold it to Lost Boys in 1998. In 2001, when Lost Boys merged with Swedish media company IconMediaLab, Lost Boys Games was spun off into an independent entity, though under the continued ownership of Mol. In 2001 Hermen Hulst became the Managing Director. Mol later established a new media company, Media Republic, which acquired 75% of Lost Boys Games in 2003. Shortly thereafter, in July 2003, Lost Boys Games was renamed Guerrilla to reflect the style of its new parent company. The company was located in a 17th century canal mansion in Amsterdam, but moved to the former Telegraaf building in 2019. The studio's first projects were Game Boy Color games with original characters. They were however unable to find a publisher as those were more interested in licensed properties. Lost Boys Games then moved on to work-for-hire projects with titles such as Tiny Toon Adventures: Dizzy's Candy Quest (Game Boy Color, 2001), Rhino Rumble (Game Boy Color, 2002), Black Belt Challenge (Game Boy Advance, 2002), and Invader (Game Boy Advance, 2002). Around 2000-2002 the studio also developed several PC racing games and a game with a Big Brother license, but for those titles there may be overlap with the pre-2000 studio Lost Boys Interactive B.V.: Grachten Racer (2000), Big Brother: The Game (2000), Speedboat Raser Europa (2001) and Miami Speedboat Racer (2002). In 2004 the studio released two major games: Killzone for Sony as a PS2 exclusive and Shellshock: Nam '67 for Eidos Interactive. After the release of Killzone, Guerrilla was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2005. It went on to create Killzone: Liberation for PlayStation Portable in 2006, and released Killzone 2 for PlayStation 3. The company was part of the SCE Worldwide Studios group and in 2011 it was managed by two of its original co-founders: Hermen Hulst and Arjan Brussee.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/f1571d60-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,2000,2024,Netherlands

Founded by Ian Andrew, essentially from royalties earned by his Spectrum game Mined-Out which was published by Rod Cousens at Quicksilva. The maddeningly playable Splat! was the first Incentive release on Spectrum and then C64. The Ket Trilogy adventure games were also released on the Spectrum. Moon Cresta for Spectrum and C64 was the biggest chart hit. Incentive was also the first industry posting for Darryl Still. He later moved on to Atari, Electronic Arts and Nvidia. The company developed the Power Load system for the cassette duplication company Dataclone to combat piracy, also using data compression techniques to reduce the cassette’s loading time drastically.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/87726954-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1983,1992,

"Piranha Games, Inc.","Inside Piranha Games There's something about the West Coast that seems to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit. A smorgasbord of cultures. Young population. A great setting for work and play. Distance from the central bureaucratic mindset. And the willingness to do things differently. Piranha Games Inc. was founded in January 2000 by Russ Bullock (programmer) and Bryan Ekman (artist), two Vancouverites who first created a 'perfect' company in their minds, and then set about to build it -- right down to details, including enviable corporate alliances, the pick of the best employees in the business, an impressive launch product that went national from the outset, pet piranhas named Belch and Burp, and a rooftop hot tub overlooking the incredible harbour and cityscape of Vancouver, Canada. Dedicated to designing and developing next generation games, Piranha spent its first eight months developing content for a prototype game. This led to a deal with Fox Interactive to develop a retail version of the concept - the successful Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza. It marked a well-received product launch for Fox and Sierra Interactive, and a solid launch for Piranha Games as an emerging business worthy of note by those who first caught wind of the new company at E3 Expo in 2001. Today, with Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza under its belt, and currently working on several exciting new projects, Piranha Games has grown into a top rate development house. Plans for the future? Like any good aquarist knows - you don't put too many piranhas in a tank. The Company intends to heed this advice and strategically develop winning titles that offer opportunities for personal creativity and financial success.

"Bullfrog Productions, Ltd.","Bullfrog Productions was a British developer. It was founded in 1987 by Les Edgar and Peter Molyneux. They were best known for their business simulations in the Theme series as well as the strategy and/or god games, such as Populous, Syndicate and Dungeon Keeper. In January 1995, to strengthen its global positioning, Bullfrog Productions merged with long time publishing partner Electronic Arts. In August 1997, Bullfrog co-founder, Peter Molyneux, left to establish a new development team, Lionhead Productions (who, incidentally, has also signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts). In September 1999, Les Edgar changed his role to consultant for Bullfrog Productions Limited, enabling him to pay more equitable attention to his other business interests. Edgar handed the reins to Bruce McMillan from Electronic Arts' Canadian studio. Following its purchase by EA, Bullfrog continued to work in its original offices in Guildford as an EA studio, and continued to display its own Bullfrog logo on the boxes of its games. In 2000, Electronic Arts merged its EA-UK offices, which had been in Langley near Slough, with the Bullfrog offices, into a new facility in Chertsey. Around August of that year the company decided to drop all further production of Bullfrog-branded products, and the former Bullfrog employees were put onto new projects such as the Harry Potter series. The last Bullfrog-branded original game was SimCoaster (also known as Theme Park Inc.), released in early 2001. The last overall Bullfrog-branded game was Quake III: Revolution, a port released later on in 2001. A few compilations of older games that Bullfrog worked on have been published since, but to all intents and purposes the brand has been dead since the move to Chertsey in 2000. Many Bullfrog developers left to found their own studios and these became Intrepid Computer Entertainment Ltd., Big Blue Box Studios Ltd. and Lionhead Studios. The latter eventually absorbed the first two and became the only studio to carry on the Bullfrog legacy.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/3e5d7f7a-bc82-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1988,2001,United Kingdom

"Deep Silver Volition, LLC","Deep Silver Volition, LLC was a development studio owned by Plaion and (re)named after its Deep Silver label. The studio was established as Volition, Inc. in November 1996 in Champaign, Illnois (USA). Initially it was a part of the development studio Parallax Software. After making Descent II, Parallax decided to split up its offices in Champaign and Ann Arbor (Michigan) into two separate companies. The Ann Arbor office became Outrage Entertainment and the one in Champaign became Volition. Both companies shared technologies, message boards and even had a common online matchmaking service, called PXO. The Volition staff was lead by Michael Kulas. In the early years the studio focused entirely on games in the space combat Freespace series. In 2000, Volition, along with its PXO service, was acquired by THQ. The studio then made very different types of games, such as the Summoner RPG series (2000-2002) and the licensed action game The Punisher (2005). In those years the studio became especially known for the Red Faction action games (2001-2011) and the Saints Row series (2006-2022). THQ also acquired the other Parallax studio Outrage Entertainment in 2002, renaming it Outrage Games, but closed it in 2004 after contributions to the PC version of Red Faction II. In August 2012 THQ canceled InSane, the game Volition had been working on with movie director Guillermo del Toro. The rights were returned to the director. Following the closure of parent company THQ in January 2013, Volition was sold to Koch Media for 22.3 million dollars and became Deep Silver Volition. The first game released under that banner was Saints Row IV (2013). Koch Media did not acquire the rights to the Red Faction and Summoner franchises, as those were sold to Nordic Games GmbH. In 2014, the company was led by Dan Cermak and had circa 300 employees. On 27 September 2017, it was announced that 30 people were laid off after the disappointing performance of Agents of Mayhem, including general manager Dan Cermak. In October of the same year, Jim Boone returned as studio development director. On 23 August 2022, the company would release their final game, Saints Row (2022), to middling reviews and a negative reaction from the fanbase. On 17 November 2022, the company was moved from the Plaion operating group of Embracer Group to Gearbox Software. The company was closed on 31 August 2023. Later in the year, part of the former Volition staff founded Shapeshifter Games.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/ca8435a2-bc78-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1998,2022,United States

It is based in Mons (Namen). The studio has developed titles for platforms such as iOS, Android, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Macintosh, as well as Kinect, 3D cameras and virtual reality technologies. Urbain and Hamaide already toyed with the idea of their own studio prior to 10Tacle's demise, as they were looking for a way to develop their Blobbies Wars concept as an XBLA game. The company has ported a large of number of existing games to mobile and handheld platforms, such as minim (2009 - iPhone/iPad), Equilibrio (2009 - iPhone), Shaun White Snowboarding: Origins (2009 - iPhone), Gridz (2010 - Bada), Starshine (2010 - iPhone), Swappin' (2012 - iPhone/iPad) and After Burner: Climax (2013 - iPhone/iPad/Android).

The company has also worked on porting multiple titles in the Armor Games flash-based Shift series, such as the original Shift (2009 - iPhone | 2011 - Android), Shift 2 (2010 - iPhone/Windows Phone | 2011 - Macintosh), and the re-worked Shift Extended (2011 - PS3/PSP mini). The team also created the game Shifting World (2012), an entirely new entry in the series, for the Nintendo 3DS. They also made Powerball (2011 - iPhone/iPad), mostly likely based on a 2008 title by Nas-Games and based on the licensed NSD Powerball brand. In 2011 Fishing Cactus adapted the Adictiz Facebook game Woof the Dog for iPhone and Android. They also reworked the iPhone game Trenches to WiiWare and iPad as Trenches Generals (2011). Original titles by Fishing Cactus are Mikks (2009 - iPhone), Péchés Mignons (2009 - iPhone), Dimension (2010 - Bada), RollOut (2010 - iPhone, together with Artik Entertainment), OXO: Tic Tac Toe Extreme (2011 - Android/iPhone), and Subway (2011 - Android).

In March 2013 the company opened a separate section on its site for serious games, advergames and gamification of projects. Titles that were one time in development, but eventually most likely never released, are the tactical party game Blobbies Wars (Windows / XBLA - but also listed as in development at the Belgian studio Bull Sheep Studios - also by Bruno Urbain), Eyeball Invaders (Windows / WiiWare), Pirations: Quest for the Pelican Tooth, and Thormäe (browser - together with White Laser Games). On 18th May 2011 the studio announced to be working on a new entry in the long-running Creatures series. Creatures 4 was announced for Windows, Macintosh and iOS.

The company has been active since 2005.

Freejam Limited,"The Climax Group was founded by Karl Jeffery in 1987 and has a long history as a European game development house. Since early 2007, the company consisted of one development studio, Climax Action based in Portsmouth, England. Around 2009, it was renamed Climax Studios Ltd.. In its early days, the company focused on additional development and ports of existing games. It is not known if the company did any work in the industry in the nine years starting from 1987, but there appears to be a link with the software house Images Software Ltd. for the titles Shadow Dancer, R-Type (Atari ST) and Ninja Spirit. That company was also established by Jeffery and most likely Climax is the continuation of it. Initially development services were done under the name Climax. Later, different names were used for the division as the company expanded. The first known work was in 1996, when Climax contributed art to the Genesis and Game Gear versions of Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble and then created their first original title, Muppets on the Go for the SEGA Pico. The team made the Saturn/PSX port Warcraft II: The Dark Saga (1997), the Saturn port of FIFA 98: Road to World Cup (1997), and the PSX ports of San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing (1998), Diablo (1998), Populous: The Beginning (1998) and The F.A. Premier League Stars. A Saturn port of Cybersled they were working on along with Namco Hometek Inc. was cancelled. At that time, the company also had a number of demos it was pitching to publishers. Halcyon (PC/Dreamcast) was an RPG that combined high level resource management with real-time battles and open-world exploration. It was set in the universe of King Arthur, at the time shortly after his death. Another was a Dragonball 'Z' game for the Saturn, Huevos based on the arcade game Joust, and World Tennis, a 3D tennis game. None of these were eventually completed. In 1999 they announced the action RPG Symphony of Light. Originally intended for the Dreamcast, it eventually became the Xbox/Windows game Sudeki in 2004. Around 1999, the company employed about 80 people and it was a licensed developer for the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo Game Boy Color. In October 1998 they already had established a separate PC division PC Studio, next to the main headquarters for console development. Shortly before, the company had also formed Game Boy World, a division for Game Boy handheld games. The entire company moved to a larger office in Fareham in 1999. In 2000, the company released the PSX ports of Sim Theme Park, Superbike 2000 and Saban's Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue. Original work was delivered through NHL Blades of Steel for Konami (Game Boy Color), Warriors of Might and Magic (Game Boy Color) and Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs (Nintendo 64). In the same period the company established a joint venture with Games Workshop Ltd. to make an online, subscription-based game about the Warhammer universe. That would eventually become Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning (2008), but by a different development studio as it was taken away from Climax in 2004. Just before the new millennium, Climax had also started expanding its business through the acquisition of studios.  Pixel Planet - (November 1999 - Climax Brighton) Anthill Studios (June 2000 - Climax Nottingham) Syrox Developments (June 2001 - Climax London)  The main development division had already been renamed Climax Fareham (Climax Solent by June 2002) to make the distinction clear. Following the quick demise of the Dreamcast, three original titles in development at that time were cancelled: Roswell Conspiracies (based on the BKN's series Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths & Legends), and the racing games Stunt Driver (made at Climax Brighton) and Austin Powers: Mojo Rally. A fourth title, Title Defense, was moved over for a PS2 release, but eventually not released. In 2000, the PSX game ATV: Quad Power Racing was completed, along with Game Boy Color titles LEGO Alpha Team (2000) and LEGO Racers (2001). After those releases the Game Boy title Gauntlet: Dark Legacy for Atari was cancelled. In the following years the different studios branched out with new titles such as the THQ MotoGP series and the RPG Sudeki. In November 2002 Climax Handheld Games was established, and in May 2003 Climax LA - the first studio on another continent - as well as a new audio facility in Brighton in October 2003. The high amount of studios made it difficult for central management, and by November 2004 the European studios were reorganized into three main brands:* Climax Action (Climax Handheld, Climax London, Climax Solent) * Climax Online (Climax Nottingham) * Climax Racing (Climax Brighton) Following the setback of the cancellation of Warhammer Online, Climax Online was closed by September 2005.  By the summer of 2006 management stated that they wanted change Climax into a one location, one studio developer with a single management team. Climax Racing was sold to Buena Vista Games, Inc. in September 2006 and Climax LA was made a business division by February 2007. The reorganization was completed in February 2008 when the Kingston offices where Climax London and Climax Handheld Games used to be housed, were closed. The team had already moved to the Climax Solent location by then. In 2009, only a single development studio remained: Climax Action, formerly called Climax Solent and the initial development division when the company first started. Eventually, the name of the division was changed into Climax Studios Ltd. Since then, the team was responsible for Silent Hill: Shattered Memories (2009), Overlord: Dark Legend (2009), Overlord Minions (2009) and Rocket Knight (2010). Climax Studios then worked on an adaptation of the television series Gormiti for the Wii and Nintendo DS as Gormiti: The Lords of Nature! released in 2010. In 2011 the studio released the PlayStation Move game Eyepet & Friends. The Climax Group would rename itself to Hyperion Ventures Limited in 2010, and Freejam Limited in 2015. As Freejam, the company developed the Robocraft series and CardLife, while Climax Studios Ltd. would be completely detached, as it was acquired by Keywords Studios in 2021. Freejam would close on 13 January 2025.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/6b89a4ea-1448-11f0-90bd-02420a000159.webp,1995,2019,United Kingdom

It was established through the merger of two very small French studios: BJL Langlois by Jean-Luc Langlois and Kilkhor by Bruno Gourier. The studio initially developed for the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS platforms and later branched out to console and hand-held systems such as the Mega Drive, SNES and Game Gear. Around 1996 the studio was about to close down, but then Daniel Macré joined the studio. He had previously worked together with Lankhor to develop an adaptation of the Sinclair QL game Wroom! for other platforms. In 1997, Lankhor entered a partnership with Eidos Interactive and created F1 World Grand Prix (1999) for the PlayStation and Windows. After the cancellation of a contract with the Japanese publisher Video System Co., Ltd. in January 2001 for an FIA licensed F1 game on PC and Xbox, Lankhor closed its doors on 31st December 2001 as the economical situation provided no new opportunities to work on new titles in 2001. Val d'Isère Ski Park Manager (February 2002) was the company's last game. Some of the developers moved on to found Corélane. Daniel Macré left the games industry permanently.

Teque London acquired Interactive Entertainment Ltd. which became its publishing arm. In February 1999 it was announced that, through a share swap agreement, the directors of Teque had become principals in Midas Interactive Entertainment BV. Teque would provide the Midas development insight but would continue to focus on the creation of driving games after creating Power F1 and World Tour Racing both in 1997.

GFI Russia,"GFI Russia is a Russian game development studio. It was first established in 1997 as MiST land and its first project was the fantasy real-time strategy game BESTiARY. Due to problems with the publishers, it was eventually cancelled. The first released game became Napoleon's Battles. Work was started in 1999 and it was released in November 2000 on the Russian market. At the time the studio was also involved with contract and localization work. An English version of the game surfaced in 2003. Around 2002 the company started trading as ZAO MiST land South. Its second title Paradise Cracked was released in 2002. It is a mix of a role-playing game with tactical combat and was also released internationally. Its third project was released in 2003: the space combat game StarCalibur developed together with Secret Sign. In the same year COPS 2170: The Power of Law was released as a prequel to Paradise Cracked, along with the expansion known in English as COPS 2170: The Power of Law - Police Stories in 2004, though there was likely never an English release for the add-on. In January 2005 the strategy game ALFA: Antiterror - Advanced War Tactics was released along with the add-on known in Russian as АЛЬФА: антитеррор - Мужская работа (translates as ""ALFA: Antiterror - Male Work"", but there was no English release). In 2003 the company was acquired by Game Factory Interactive and in 2006 it was reformed as GFI Russia. The studio set out to develop two games in the Jagged Alliance series: Jagged Alliance 3 and Jagged Alliance 3D, but those were never released as Strategy First, the owner of the IP, withdrew the license. Originally a game called African Alliance was in development, but it was halted in September 2005 and the assets were moved to the Jagged Alliance 3D project. The Jagged Alliance 3 game was reworked as Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge and released in 2007. Other titles developed as GFI Russia include the strategy games Warfare (2008) and Officers (2009). The studio has since also developed casual hidden object games such as Jessica: Mysterious Journey and Jessica: Secret of the Caribbean, both released in 2009 and developed together with Waterfall Interactive. In May 2008 the main Game Factory Interactive company merged with the Russian distributor Russobit-M into the Bestway group. It is not known whether GFI Russia still operates with that name, but between 2007 and the end of 2011 the company was likely involved with the localization and the operation of multiplayer-only games such as Audition 2, Mythos and NavyField for the Russian market. Since 22nd March 2011 all these multiplayer services has been unified under the name Belver.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/c92ff04c-bc78-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,2000,2022,Russia

Atreid joined an international distribution force and became Mindscape Bordeaux in 1995, releasing Warriors, and Al Unser Jr. Arcade Racing, which was chosen by Bill Gates for the promotion of the release of Windows 95.

Larian Studios NV,"Larian Studios is a Belgian game developer and publisher founded in 1996 and the only high profile developer in the country. They are located in Oudenaarde, near Gent, but have offices all over the world. They have released many software products such as educational titles and casino games, but specialize in role-playing games such as their original Divinity series and most recently also Baldur's Gate III. The company is led by the founder Swen Vincke. Their first game was the real-time strategy title The L.E.D. Wars (1997). It was a project used for short-term finance to convince publishers of the large project they were working on: The Lady, the Mage and the Knight (LMK). That game was however cancelled in 1999 after disagreements with co-developer attic Entertainment Software. In 2002 an isometric RPG was released as a second project: Divine Divinity, followed shortly by the sequel Beyond Divinity (2004). Next, they created the PC2TV game KetnetKick (2004) where children could create content that was displayed on the national children's channel Ketnet. It was later also adapted as the BBC children's MMO Adventure Rock for the British market. In October 2008 an updated version called KetnetKick 2 was released based on the same concept. In 2009 GulliLand was created as a similar concept for the French Jeunesse TV. In January 2010, the Divinity sequel Divinity II: Ego Draconis was released. That was their first title also to be released on a console platform. In 2011, the company released five educational games for children aged seven to eleven to teach mathematics. They were released as five titles in the Monkey Tales series and later also adapted for international markets. On 9 January 2012, founder Swen Vincke announced that all new Larian titles would be self-published, starting with Divinity: Dragon Commander in 2013. The company has a studio in Saint Petersburg, Russia called Larian Studios Saint Petersburg, most likely since around 2014. It is based on the team of Elverils, LLC, but it is not clear if Larian acquired the studio or attracted members of the team to set up a new division. Elverils previously worked together with Larian. On 14 January 2015, a Canadian studio was established as Larian Québec Inc. and on 21 January of the same month Larian Studios Games Limited in Dublin, Ireland. The company released Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition in 2015. Next Divinity: Original Sin II was released in 2016, an open world RPG and a sequel to the acclaimed Divinity: Original Sin. It was funded through a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising over $2 million. In 2020, the studio launched Baldur's Gate III, a new entry in the long-running Dungeons & Dragons franchise. It was launched in Early Access with gradual content updates. On 6 November 2019, a new development studio was established Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, called Larian GCL Sdn Bhd. The location was chosen specifically to establish a 24-hour cycle, passing work from Québec, Ireland, Belgium, Russia and Malaysia with different time zones. On 17 February 2021, the company announced the acquisition of Turbulenz, based in Guildford, United Kingdom. It was renamed Larian Guilford and assists with the development of Baldur's Gate III. On 2 June 2021, Larian announced the establishment of a new office Larian Studios Spain in Barcelona, Spain, as a seventh studio, following the acquisition of BlitWorks, who previously ported Divinity: Original Sin II to Nintendo Switch and brought Baldur's Gate III to Stadia. The name BlitWorks remained for publishing activities, but the development team was rebranded. On 3 August 2023, Larian released the full version of Baldur's Gate III on Windows, with other platforms following by the end of that year. The game quickly received unanimous acclaim from players and critics, becoming one of the all-time highest-rated games on multiple score aggregators. On 20 May 2024, the company announced the establishment of Larian Studios Poland.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/89f56d60-335d-11ee-aa00-02420a00011c.webp,1997,2024,Belgium

"Bitmap Brothers, The","Founded in 1987 by Steve Kelly, Mike Montgomery and Eric Matthews the Bitmap Brothers were the original ‘rockstar’ developers - a small, but highly successful development team that prized quality over quantity, and depth over glitz. The company has been responsible for several memorable titles, released on a range of formats that have included 8, 16 and 32-bit home computers and consoles - from the Commodore 64 through to 21st century PCs and consoles. The first game from the Bitmaps, Xenon, was released in 1988, a sophisticated shoot-‘em up that, through a combination of cutting-edge graphics and challenging gameplay, became the first Amiga game to enter the UK top 40 charts. The sequel, Xenon 2: Megablast, was an even bigger success. Also in 1988, the Bitmap Brothers followed up the success of Xenon with the futuristic beat-‘em up ballgame, Speedball. Its sequel Speedball 2:Brutal Deluxe was their most critically-acclaimed game. A third title in the series, Speedball 2100 on the PlayStation, was released in September 2000. A 3D version entitled Speedball Arena was abandoned mid-project. Other hits included TV tie-in Magic Pockets, much-delayed Steampunk shooter The Chaos Engine, and real-time strategy game Z. Their last game was World War II: Frontline Command. This was a WW2 RTS that used the 3D engine from Steel Soldiers. At one point the studio was split into two studio sites - one in Wapping, London, the other in Harrogate in the north of England. In 1998, Kelly and Matthews both stepped down from the board to concentrate on games design and programming respectively, Mike Montgomery took on the role of Managing Director and successfully drove the company forward, investing in personnel and equipment that enabled the company to develop a new range of next-generation games software. Employing over 20 designers, programmers and artists, the Bitmap Brothers remained fiercely independent and entirely privately owned.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/07f46d76-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1988,2021,United Kingdom

Revolution Software Ltd.,"Revolution Software is a UK game development studio established in 1990 by Charles Cecil, Tony Warriner, David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. The company focuses on adventure titles and its first release was Lure of the Temptress in 1992. The early titles were all developed using their proprietary Virtual Theatre engine, which was used for the last time in the second Broken Sword game Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror (1997). The studio is especially known for the 1994 dystopian adventure Beneath a Steel Sky, and the Broken Sword series with four games released between 1994 and 2006. Around 2000 the studio worked on the licensed titles Disney's Story Studio: Mulan and Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado, and launched In Cold Blood as an original IP. Following the fourth Broken Sword game Secrets of the Ark: A Broken Sword Game in 2006, no new titles were released for a few years. Instead, the studio worked on a director's cut and a remastered version of earlier installments in the series. The traditional PC focus was expanded by making them available on new platforms such as Nintendo DS, Wii, Android and iOS. In July 2012, a fifth game in the Broken Sword series, Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse, was announced through a Kickstarter campaign based on crowd funding. When the target was reached on 5th September 2012, stretch goals were made available along with option to greenlight the development of Beneath a Steel Sky 2.

Rob Denton previously co-founded Interesting Systems in 1990 and was responsible for the multi-user BBS text-based RPG Darkness Falls (initially released in 1991 as Tempest). Much of the game code would later serve for the Mythic game Dark Age of Camelot. Many of the original developers of the individual companies eventually ending up working for Mythic. The company name Interworld Productions was changed to Mythic Entertainment in November 1997 when it was found out there was already another Interworld. Mythic was very prolific with the releases of online games in the mid to late nineties. The studio was responsible for Castles II Online (1995), Rolemaster: Magestorm (1996), Invasion Earth (1997), Rolemaster: Bladelands (1997), Silent Death: Online (1997), Splatterball (1997), Aliens Online (1998), Godzilla Online (1998), Starship Troopers: Battlespace (1998), Darkness Falls: The Crusade (1999), Darkstorm: The Well of Souls (1999), Spellbinder: The Nexus Conflict (1999) and Independence Day Online (2000). They covered a wide variety of genres, ranging from regular RPGs to space-based battles and team-based first-person shooters. Some of these were developed in cooperation with other companies (such as Centropolis) and were often only available to US players, through AOL or the GameStorm service, owned by Kesmai Corporation. The studio's real breakthrough title was the fantasy MMORPG Dark Age of Camelot based on the story of King Arthur. Development was started in 1999. In 2000 the company was financially backed by Abandon Entertainment and the title was released in 2001, with Anarchy Online, Ultima Online and EverQuest as its main competitors. It was the studio's first MMOG (massively multiplayer online game). Previous titles were all played in smaller teams or squads. The game is still maintained today and it received numerous expansions over the years. Following the release Mythic started work on a new game in 2002, Imperator Online. It was based on an alternate history where the Roman Republic never disappeared and eventually evolved into an empire covering multiple planets and with access to space travel. The project was eventually cancelled in 2005. In June 2006 Mythic Entertainment was acquired by Electronic Arts, which had no MMORPG division at the time, and renamed EA Mythic. The studio would, among else, maintain and develop new content for Ultima Online. After an internal restructuring the company's name was changed back to Mythic Entertainment in July 2008. In an interview that month Mark Jacobs explained that the name was changed back because of an open attitude EA had taken to the development studios it owned at the time. Mythic's next title was the fantasy MMORPG Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, based on the popular Warhammer universe. It was launched in September 2009. The year before, in January 2008, EA had also acquired the acclaimed (offline) RPG development studio BioWare Corporation and on 24 June 2009 it was announced EA would restructure both Mythic and BioWare as a single RPG/MMO division headed by BioWare General Manager Ray Muzyka. Mythic general manager and co-founder Mark Jacobs had resigned the day before and was replaced by Rob Denton. By June 2010 the company was renamed BioWare Mythic and eventually completely integrated into the main BioWare RPG group. The studio name returned as a developer of mobile games, first the free-to-play action RPG Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar for iOS in August 2013 followed by the free-to-play game Dungeon Keeper in December 2013. On 29 May 2014, it was reported parent company Electronic Arts closed the division. Work on mobile titles was relocated to other studios, while some former Mythic staff would establish Broadsword Online Games, to which the maintenance of Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot were transferred under license from EA.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d8a04906-bc81-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1996,2013,United States

Before becoming NetherRealm, it was known as Midway Chicago, Midway Games' original development studio that developed all their arcade games. Later, it focused solely on games for home and portable consoles, with titles such as Blitz: The League (2005), Stranglehold (2007) and Game Party (2007). It was based in the same facility as Midway Amusement Games and just across the street of the main Midway office. On 12 February 2009, Midway filed for bankruptcy and on 1 July 2009, most of the game assets, including the Midway studio, were sold to Warner Bros. Shortly after, the studio was renamed WB Games Chicago. Almost everyone not involved with the Mortal Kombat franchise was laid off, including the team that had been working on the Hero open-world superhero game since 2006. Chip Sineni was one of those employees and he went on to found Phosphor Games in 2009, to continue the project building it up again from scratch and he took along many former Midway Chicago members. In June 2010, the division was renamed NetherRealm Studios, after the NeatherRealm universe where the Mortal Kombat series is set. It is also led by the series co-creator Ed Boon. The first NetherRealm title was Mortal Kombat in April 2011, as a reboot of the series. The company would expand the franchise with Mortal Kombat X (2015), Mortal Kombat 11 (2019) and yet another reboot with Mortal Kombat 1 (2023). A second title, Batman: Arkham City Lockdown for iOS, was released in December 2011. In June 2012, a third title was revealed, the fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us.

Remedy Entertainment Oyj,"Remedy Entertainment Ltd. is a Finnish development studio founded in 1995 and based in Espoo. Many of the founding members were previously part of the demo scene group Future Crew. The studio's first game was the top-down racing shooter Death Rally (1996), followed by the two Max Payne games (2001 and 2003) featuring a titular protagonist in a story of hard-boiled revenge. The game popularised the use of bullet time in games, a technique best known from The Matrix movies, mixed with action sequences reminiscent of John Woo movies, but entirely set in against film noir backdrop. After having sold the movie options in 2001, a film based on the story starring Mark Wahlberg was eventually released in 2008. Max Payne 3 was released in 2012, but it was designed by Rockstar Vancouver and the series writer Sam Lake was not involved. The company released its fourth game, the action thriller Alan Wake, in 2010. Despite having released a small number of games in its relatively long history, the studio does fine as all of their titles have been received very well, both by the press and in sales numbers. Alan Wake was the studio's first title not initially released on the PC. It remained an Xbox 360 exclusive for two years and had a disappointing start in sales, although according to Remedy team leader Oskari Häkkinen the sales continued well post-launch. In 2012 the PC version was made available with a number of tweaks and the studio also released the more action-focused spin-off Alan Wake's American Nightmare as an Xbox 360 XBLA game. A remastered version of the original game was released in 2021. The studio is responsible for the popular benchmark application 3DMark. Initially created as Final Reality in 1997, Remedy soon established the separate company Futuremark Oy, referencing the demo group's name, to handle the application. In January 2008 Futuremark established its own game development studio as Futuremark Games Studio.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/219f1cfc-e2b8-11ed-822c-02420a000158.webp,1996,2025,Finland

Eden Games S.A.S.,"Eden Games is a game development studio. It was originally owned by Atari and based in Lyon, France. The company was founded on 4 January 1998 as Eden Studios by Stéphane Baudet, Frédéric Jay and David Nadal. All three of them previously worked together at Infogrames as a part of the internal Eden development group. By forming the company, Eden became independent. The studio initially signed contracts with Infogrames for two V-Rally games, but asserted its independence by signing a publishing agreement with Electronic Arts in 1999. In May 2002, the company was sold to Infogrames (that later became Atari), which already held 19.8% of the company's shares. In September 2003, the name was changed to Eden Games S.A.S. Most recently, the studio is known for the Alone in the Dark reboot (2008) and the Test Drive Unlimited series. In May 2011, it became known the team of 80 people faced redundancies of over 50 jobs. Eden felt it was a victim of mismanagement by Atari and decided to go on strike to negotiate on the redundancy plan, get fair compensation, and be involved with the future of the studio after the restructuring. The studio was closed on 1 March 2013, but reopened on 31 October 2013. In 2011, a number of developers left to found the studio Blossom Minds. Eden Games, long under Atari’s ownership, was placed into judicial liquidation on 29 January 2013, effectively shuttering the studio. Despite a promise by Atari earlier in 2012 that the studio ""had not closed"", the liquidation marked its end as part of Atari. However, the studio rose again: on 31 October 2013, former employees relaunched Eden Games as an independent development operation, no longer associated with Atari. This revival was made possible thanks to funding by investment firms ID Invest and Monster Capital  Under its new independent structure, Eden Games shifted its focus primarily to racing games for mobile platforms and later for consoles. Its first post-relaunch release was GT Spirit on Apple TV in December 2015. They then created the Gear.Club franchise, developed with support from publishers like Microids and Apple, and in partnership with Codemasters and Electronic Arts on F1®. The success of Gear.Club Unlimited on Nintendo Switch led to an expanded partnership to bring Gear.Club Unlimited 2 to next-gen consoles (Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5), announced for Q4 2021. From 2017 to 2021, Eden Games operated as a subsidiary of Engine Gaming & Media (also known as Engine Media). During this time, they continued to build their racing portfolio, including titles like Gear.Club Unlimited 2 and Gear.Club: Stradale. In April 2022, Engine Gaming & Media sold its interest in Eden Games to Animoca Brands for approximately USD 15.3 million (~USD 16 million). Animoca, a Hong Kong-based leader in blockchain-based entertainment and metaverse gaming, acquired Eden to bolster its REVV Motorsport ecosystem and develop new Web3/blockchain-based racing games featuring NFTs and play-to-earn mechanics. Animoca’s CEO Yat Siu noted that Eden’s 25 years of racing game expertise would bring significant value to its metaverse ambitions. Eden Games remains active and is still based in Lyon, France, now as part of Animoca Brands. The studio continues to work on racing games across mobile, PC, and console platforms, and is involved in blockchain/metaverse game development under Animoca's umbrella. The studio has also developed several racing titles for Microids. The company is led by two original founders, David Nadal and Jean-Yves Geffroy.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/3de4130c-8e84-11f0-be73-02420a0001d7.webp,1997,2025,France

Halo Studios,"Halo Studios, initially 343 Industries, is a game development studio based in Kirkland, Washington (USA). It was created as a subsidiary to Microsoft Game Studios in 2007 to handle the further development of the Halo franchise after Bungie became an independent company once again. The company's original name was a reference to 343 Guilty Spark, an AI in the Halo universe. 343's first project was Halo: Waypoint, launched in 2009 as an application for post-Halo: Reach games. It provides player statistics, updates and browsing enhancements. The next project that 343 worked on was Halo: Combat Evolved - Anniversary, an enhanced remake of the original Halo: Combat Evolved. In 2011, it was announced that 343 would be not only developing Halo 4, but also two further titles, which are said to make up The Reclaimer Trilogy, and would serve as a sequel trilogy to the first three Halo games. These would eventually become Halo 5: Guardians (2015) and Halo: Infinite (2021). The company would also handle the remastered versions of prior games ported to PC and newer Xbox consoles - Halo Wars: Definitive Edition and Halo: The Master Chief Collection. On 6 October 2024, the company was renamed to Halo Studios, despite already having a Halo reference in their original name, as part of a company restructure. On the same day, they unveiled their Project Foundry development testbed which uses Unreal Engine 5.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/8a6de8f6-84d5-11ef-8efe-02420a000120.webp,2011,2026,United States

Housemarque Ltd.,"The two founding members of the two Finnish game companies Bloodhouse Ltd. and Terramarque Ltd. established Housemarque Ltd. in early 1995. Both companies had developed games for the Amiga previously. As PC game markets really started to emerge after the collapse of Amiga manufacturer Commodore in 1994, Housemarque was established in order to take advantage of the growing PC game markets. The company is headquartered in Helsinki, Finland. The studio started with the development of 3 PC CD-ROM titles: Super Stardust (1996), Alien Incident (1996) and The Reap (1997) from 1995 to the end of the fiscal year 1999. Although none of the games were commercial hits, they all received good reviews among the game press. Internationally distributed computer games were not the only products the company was doing. Other activities include the development of an on-line world called Con Quest, consulting for the Finnish National Lottery Company (Veikkaus) and small advertainment games. In early 1999 Housemarque signed a contract with Infogrames to develop Supreme Snowboarding (known as Boarder Zone in the US) for PC CD-ROM. Sights were set for the Christmas release. As the game had been in development well before signing a contract with Infogrames, their snowboarding game had already gained some reputation being one of the most visually stunning games around. For instance, 3DFX showed the game at their stand at E3 1998 in Atlanta. Supreme Snowboarding was also one of the few games presented at the official launch event of Pentium III processors in February 1999. Intel presented the game at the Game Developers Conference in March. After releasing TransWorld Snowboarding for the Xbox in 2002 as the sequel to Supreme Snowboarding the company released the snowboarding game Flo Boarding for Nokia's N-Gage in 2003, and started development on the internal technology for a PS2 title. In 2004 the karaoke game Staraoke was released for the PC. The following years more mobile games were released: The Chronicles of Narnia 3D (2005) for J2ME and BREW, and Gizmondo Motocross 2005 (2005) for Gizmondo. In 2007 they released Super Stardust HD as a downloadable game for the PlayStation 3, continuing its early series. Since then the company has mostly been focused on downloadable games for the Xbox 360 and PS3, such as Golf: Tee It Up! (2008), Super Stardust Portable (2008) for the PSP, Dead Nation (2010) and Outland (2011). In 2011 the studio made its first iOS game Furmins and three Angry Birds games were ported to the PS3 and Xbox 360 as Angry Birds Trilogy (2012). In 2014 Resogun was a launch game for the PlayStation 4 as a spiritual successor to the Super Stardust games. In March 2014 the 2010 title Dead Nation was released as an enhanced version for the PS4 as Dead Nation: Apocalypse Edition. Despite development for a wide range of platforms, the studio has always had close ties with the PlayStation console platform since the PS3 with exclusive titles such as Super Stardust HD (2007), Dead Nation (2010), Resogun (2013), Alienation (2016), Matterfall (2017) and Returnal (2021). On 29th June 2021 Sony announced the studio's acquisition as a first party developer part of the PlayStation Studios family.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/889c6b32-cb0f-11ed-8af0-02420a0001ab.webp,1996,2021,Finland

He previously worked at Midway Chicago along with many of the other Phosphor team members. When Midway was put up for sale in 2009 and Warner Bros. bought the Chicago studio, it was only really interested in continuing the Mortal Kombat franchise and everyone else not involved with that project was laid off. The team Sineni was involved with had been working on Hero since 2006, an open-world superhero game. They did a two-week crunch when rumours about Midway being up for sale were started to try and get a publisher interested, but eventually everything was put up for sale, including that IP. The Phosphor Games studio only had a physical office about a year after the lay-offs, but it still included many of the original Hero members. The project resurfaced at Phosphor as Project Awakened, but everything had to be redone from scratch as the IP and work could not be transferred.

Slipgate Ironworks ApS,"Slipgate Ironworks, originally founded as Interceptor Entertainment is an independent game development studio based in Herning, Denmark and it was established in 2010. It was founded and is led by CEO and president Frederik Schreiber. Most of the team members have a background in indie games and modding and then got a job in the industry, at companies such as Sony Online Entertainment, Epic Games and Naughty Dog. The studio's first project was started as a mod called Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded, a remake of Duke Nukem 3D. It originally started as a fan project, but through agreements with Gearbox Software, 3D Realms Entertainment and Apogee Software, Interceptor was eventually granted a personal non-commercial license to the Duke Nukem franchise. After the initial announcement in the fall of 2010, the game was put on hold in September 2011. Initially called Duke Nukem Next-Gen and in November 2010 officially Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded, the game became standalone and would use Unreal Engine 3. In 2013, Schreiber spoke about the delay and stated that the game was put on hold because of the disappointing reception of Gearbox' title Duke Nukem Forever (2011). He stated that Reloaded was a better game and that showing or releasing it would destroy Forever's sales opportunities, which is why Gearbox had it put on hold. In 2013, the studio's first games were released. Working together with Apogee, Interceptor worked on ports for Duke Nukem (PC) and Duke Nukem II (PC/iOS). In July 2013 Rise of the Triad was released for PC, a remake of the 1994 first-person shooter Rise of the Triad: Dark War and maintaining the spirit of the original game. It was originally announced as Project Rogue. The team has another first-person shooter in development currently called Pathfinder. It is also based on an established franchise, but yet to be revealed. In February 2014, the first traces were revealed of Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction, a top-down action role-playing game. At the end of February, Gearbox (owner of the Duke Nukem IP) sued 3D Realms / Apogee Software Ltd. (creator of the Duke Nukem IP) over that game's development. The legal status is unknown, but in early March, Interceptor bought 3D Realms / Apogee Software Ltd. The company does not own the separate company Apogee Software LLC, which holds for instance the rights to Rise of the Triad, the franchise Interceptor developed a reboot for, as well as the rights to the name Apogee. The company filed for insolvency in December 2016 and was known as Slipgate Studios since April 2017. On 21 March 2019, they renamed themselves to Slipgate Ironworks to resolve confusion with a VR game studio of the same name, while John Romero agreed to give them the name and trademark of his former company Slipgate Ironworks (2006-2009).",https://cdn.mobygames.com/53a2f2d2-1cf9-11f0-aa24-02420a0001a2.webp,2013,2025,Denmark

Spellbound Entertainment AG,"Spellbound was founded by Armin Gessert in 1994 who was one of the three developers of the game The Great Giana Sisters (first released for the C64 in 1987). The Spellbound team initially produced graphics for the company Attic and thus took part in the creation of the role-playing game ""Das schwarze Auge III"" (""The Black Eye III""). This collaboration led to a commission from the company Fantasy Productions. They were to develop a game for the most successful series of German science fiction novels ""Perry Rhodan"" of Pabel publishing house. Spellbound’s first title was a strategy game called Perry Rhodan: Operation Eastside released in 1998 under the label Fantasy Productions. The Games The first game completely developed by the company on her own was the economic simulation Airline Tycoon. Infogrames (ATARI) published the title in 1997. The game never actually managed to enter the top ten, but it turned out to be a successful long seller in various territories and can still be found among budget titles in stores. In 1998 Airline Tycoon First Class came out, followed by Airline Tycoon Evolution in 2002; both of these add-ons were distributed by Monte Cristo. In 2003 the last add-on for the time being was introduced: Airline Tycoon Deluxe. In December 1998 the Spellbound team began with the development of their second original game. It was designed to be a real time strategy game and was supposed to take place in a location, which at that time had not been exploited in computer games to a large extent before: The Wild West. The game was called Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive and it turned out to be Spellbound’s biggest success and most critically acclaimed title so far. The game received praise from the press for its AI and an innovation called ""Quick Actions"" which allowed the player to plan their moves in advance. Just like the first part of ""Airline Tycoon"", ""Desperados"" was distributed by Infogrames (ATARI). In 2001 it was at the top of the game ratings (charts) in some countries for several weeks. The game’s cinematics won the ""Animago award"" in 2001 and the game itself is still ranked second in the ""all-time-best-list"" of the German magazine ""PC-Games"" in the category for strategy games. An expansion to ""Desperados"" featuring new locations and characters was supposed to follow but was not released due to reasons which have not been completely uncovered up to today. Supposedly, there were company politics involved on publisher Infogrames’ side which involved budget and market focus. Ever since, some fans of ""Desperados"" have been waiting and yearning for an add-on or a sequel to the game. Another term that is often mentioned in this context is the so-called ""Webisodes"". These were additional levels Spellbound had planned to release via their website – possibly instead of a full-size add-on – to allow players of ""Desperados"" to continue the gaming experience. Due to the success of ""Desperados"", Spellbound was able to expand its team. To be able to ensure a smooth game production with the increased team, the company introduced a form of ""Extreme Programming"" (a.k.a. ""XP"") to the development process in 2001, which was adjusted to the needs of game production. This ""XP"" process was introduced by technical director Stéphane Becker. The first game created using these new methods was Robin Hood: Die Legende von Sherwood (""Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood""). ""Robin Hood"" was produced in cooperation with the French publisher Wanadoo Edition, today known as MC2.  For ""Robin Hood"" the Spellbound team refined the techniques which had been developed for ""Desperados"". The 2D-engine ""Desperados"" had used was improved and a new system of compression for sprites was introduced. All sprites were equipped with dynamic lighting processes and the ""Quick Actions"" were extended considerably. ""Robin Hood"" was released in 2002. The game achieved top scores of up to 96% (Gen 4) in the press. ""Robin Hood"" could also repeat the success of ""Desperados"", in particular because of its cinematics which won the ""Animago Award"" as well. In 2003 Spellbound Entertainment Ltd. expanded its product range by two more genres. The company published its first action adventure with Chicago 1930 and its first shooter with Rauchende Colts (""Smoking Colts""). By releasing ""Rauchende Colts"" Spellbound entered the market segment of low budget games.  Additionally Spellbound Entertainment Ltd. appeared as publisher of its own products for the first time by releasing ""Rauchende Colts"" and ""Airline Tycoon Deluxe"" in 2003. Both the company and the press were not pleased with the game ""Chicago 1930"". It did not meet the former’s expectations in sales. As a consequence, Spellbound released a large portion of the team who worked on the title. The core team of the original ""Desperados"" stayed with the company. Among the employees who were laid off were Stéphane Becker, Jean-Michel Stenger and Martin Kuppe who went on to found a new company in Strasburg called Creative Patterns which employed most of the original ""Desperados"" team members.  In 2003, Spellbound began production of its first 3D real-time game, the sequel to ""Desperados"". Featuring an all new 3D engine, two perspectives (isometric and third person), a new character as well as new abilities for all heroes and new Western sets and developed by a new team, Desperados 2: Cooper’s Revenge was longingly awaited by fans of the original. Published by ATARI, the game was released in Germany on April 27th 2006.  Right after the completion of Desperados 2: Cooper’s Revenge production of an add-on titled ""Desperados 2: Conspiracies"" began. Shortly before production was complete, publisher Atari pulled out and left the team stranded with an almost finished game. Just like the add-on of its predecessor, the Desperados 2 Add-on was threatened to be never released despite being nearly complete. Luckily, Spellbound found a new publisher in Russia, Noviy Disk. Finally, German publisher digital tainment pool (dtp) brought the game to Germany and released it under their Anaconda label on June 6th, 2007. The Location   Located in the city of Kehl am Rhein in the state Baden-Württemberg in south-western Germany, Spellbound has always had a history of being a French-German developer. With the French city of Strasburg being right across the river Rhein opposite to Kehl the company could always employ people from both countries with both their individual and cultural backgrounds. It is that cultural diversity which the company believes has always proven to be advantageous for game development. In 2011, the company moved to Offenburg to make room for their extended personell (40 to 120). Legacy   A number of employees (Stéphane Becker, Jean-Michel Stenger and Martin Kuppe) left the company in 2004 to found the French game development studio Creative Patterns. They eventually took along artists Isabelle Gadbled and Fabrice Weiss, and game designer Vincent Lalyman. Closure   In February 2012, the company founded the subsidiary Spellbound Entertainment GmbH in Berlin which was supposed to develop browser and mobile games. However, in March 2012 Spellbound Entertainment AG had to file for insolvency and was closed in July 2012.

The game was listed for eight continuous months in the German Media Control PC games charts with the best position attained in February 2001. In March 2001 ""America"" was voted ""Game of the month"" by Germany's largest computer game magazine ""Computerbild-Spiele"". Having sold more than 250.000 copies worldwide the game marked the company's entry into the segment of full price PC games. The next titles released in 2003 were two real-time strategy games: Castle Strike, in which the player controls one of three tribes in medieval times, and No Man's Land, which features 300 years of history of North America, both of which underlined the focus of Related Designs to producing real-time strategy titles. As of 2006, they have handled the Anno / A.D. series of games. Ubisoft Entertainment acquired a 30% share of the company in April 2007 and became the company's exclusive publisher. They would fully acquire the studio on 11 April 2013. In 2014, the company was renamed to Blue Byte Mainz, and would work closely with Blue Byte's main Düsseldorf studio.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/6288c084-ab6c-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp,1996,2025,Germany
WMS Industries Inc.,"The company name Williams Electronics, Inc. was used since at least 1967 on flyers for electro-mechanic arcade machines. It is unknown to what exact entity this refers to as Williams Electronics, Inc. was incorporated in 1974 (Illinois). This may originate from the purchase of Williams Manufacturing by Seeburg Corporation in 1964. The name was changed to WMS Industries Inc. in 1987, shortly after Williams Electronic Games Inc. was formed to take over the arcade and pinball business. WMS Industries and Williams Electronic Games Inc. made headline news with their $8 million acquisition of Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., Inc. in 1988. The purchase included all of Bally Midway's coin-operated amusement game manufacturing business. More importantly for the videogame industry, it also included Midway, which had become very successful in the development of coin-operated arcade games as well as videogames. Midway Manufacturing Company  was incorporated and added to the WMS group of subsidiaries at this time. In 1992, Williams began to manufacture pinball machines with the Bally name after acquiring the exclusive name rights. In 1994, WMS Industry purchased Tradewest and formed Williams Entertainment Inc. which published, developed and distributed their own unique games as well as those made by their fellow subsidiary Midway Games. Then in 1996 WMS Industries acquired Time-Warner Interactive Inc., which included Atari Games. It is believed that this purchase kick-started the 1996 formation of Midway Home Entertainment Inc., a division of Midway Games Inc.  Williams Entertainment Inc. was merged into the new corporation and an Atari Games Division was formed. In 1998 Midway Games Inc. was spun off and sold to its stockholders to become independently owned and operated. In Oct. 1999, WMS Industries announced to shut down all pinball operations and the Atari Games division to focus on slot machine development.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/c5c91d62-ab6a-11ed-b430-02420a0001a0.webp,1973,2023,United States

The second title was also the first in the series to be taken to other platforms aside from Windows: the Wii and the Nintendo DS. That experiment was however not repeated for the titles afterwards. After finishing the Runaway trilogy, Péndulo revisited its second game Hollywood Monsters with the sequel The Next Big Thing (2011). The team released Yesterday in March 2012. It was their first game that moved away from the typical quirky characters and humour Péndulo is known for. It has a much more darker atmosphere and a twisted plot.

"Pandemic Studios, LLC","Pandemic Studios, LLC was a game development studio based in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1998 with an equity investment by Activision and lasted more than ten years, until the closure in 2009. It was helmed by Josh Resnick (President) and Andrew Goldman (CEO) who both worked at Activision previously. The studio's first titles, Battlezone II: Combat Commander (1999) and Dark Reign 2 were both sequels to Activision games. In 2000 Andrew Payne and Adam Iarossi left the Los Angeles studio to start the satellite studio Pandemic Studio Pty Ltd in the Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley (Australia). The studio was also referred to Pandemic Brisbane or Pandemic Australia. The Australian team's first title was Army Men RTS (2002). Later, the division would work on the Destroy All Humans! franchise with the titles Destroy All Humans! (2005) and Destroy All Humans! 2 (2006). The US company continued to work for a large number of publishers, such as Midway, THQ, Electronic Arts and LucasArts. In 2003, Midway terminated Pandemic's contract, which led the studio to sue the publishing company. In the same year, the company moved from its Santa Monica location to Westwood. During those years the studio worked on Triple Play 2002 for EA (2002), Star Wars: The Clone Wars for LucasArts (2002), Full Spectrum Warrior as a new franchise for THQ (2004), Star Wars: Battlefront (2004) and Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005) for LucasArts (2004), and Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction as another new franchise for LucasArts (2005). In 2006 Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers was released. In November 2005 the company formed an alliance with with BioWare Corporation, backed financially by Elevation Partners. Through the operation a holding company called VG Holding Corp was created. BioWare's two co-founders Greg Zeschuk and Ray Muzyka, and Pandemic's two co-founders Andrew Goldman and Josh Resnick, became shareholders and senior executives. John Riccitiello from Elevation became the company's CEO. In October 2006, it was announced a second development team at the Australian branch had been formed, which led to the creation of several Destroy All Humans! titles where the US studio partially contributed to the first title. On 11 October 2007, it was announced VG Holding Corp, including both BioWare and Pandemic, would be acquired by Electronic Arts, effective January 2008. On 7 January 2008, the company officially became a part of the EA Games label. Two more games were created the next years: Mercenaries 2: World in Flames as a second title in the Mercenaries series (2008 - but now for EA) and The Lord of the Rings: Conquest (2009). Meanwhile, a team at the Australian studio got into trouble working on a movie adaptation of The Dark Knight and was eventually let go. Following a major restructuring by Electronic Arts, the Australian studio was set ""free"" and a small team was left with the rights to the open world game tentatively called The Next Big Thing, but working independently and no longer as a part of Pandemic or EA, which means the Australian studio was officially closed. The US studio continued to work on the free-roaming World War II title The Saboteur. Following an announcement by Electronic Arts in November 2009 that it would cut 1,500 jobs at its different development outfits, Pandemic Studios was hit hard and on 18th November it was confirmed the studio would be closed down, following the completion of development on The Saboteur and its release at the end of 2009. EA said the Pandemic brand and franchises would live on and a core IP team was folded into Electronic Arts Los Angeles. The rest of the team was let go, including its top executives: former studio CEO Andrew Goldman, former studios president Josh Resnick and vice president of product development Greg Borrud. At the end of November, a new title by the trimmed-down Pandemic team was announced: Mercs Inc, a new entry in the Mercenaries series. Development was supposed to be done at the new location of Playa Vista, as a part of EA Los Angeles, but the game was never released.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/e87fec44-c42b-11ed-aaf0-02420a000121.webp,1999,2024,United States

13AM Games Inc.,"13AM Games is a game development studio based in Toronto, Canada, established in 2014. One of the co-founders is Alex Rushdy, acting as CEO of the company. The studio debuted with the platformer Runbow in 2015. Released across multiple platforms, total downloads reached almost two million in 2022, with a significant number of those coming from Xbox Live Games with Gold. The game was originally intended as a small project the developers could put on their resume and move on, but the success led to new projects at the studio. In 2016 Pirate Pop Plus was released, a game by dadako for which 13AM provided additional development, porting and the publishing.

It was published by WayForward Technologies. 13AM Games previously worked together with WayForward to get their character Shantae in Runbow.

NEON Software GmbH,"NEON Software was a German development studio founded in 1993 by  Antony Christoulakis, Boris Triebel, Jan Jöckel, Michael Büttner, and Peter Thierolf. The latter previously co-founded Kaiko in late 1990. A little later Matthias Wiederwach (also with Kaiko) joined as a shareholder. After some games commissioned for advertising NEON picked up the development of the tentatively named platformer Timet: the Flying Squirrel that was originally started at Kaiko. Aiming to become a console developer NEON struck a deal with publisher Ocean Software Ltd., who attempted to launch Mr. Nutz as a mascot with a SNES game. Because of the thematic similarities, Timet became Mr. Nutz: Hoppin' Mad as a sequel to Ocean's Mr. Nutz (1994). After the Amiga release work on a SEGA Mega Drive port was started but eventually never finished because of Ocean's dwindling interest in the platform. Ocean was satisfied with the work however and NEON signed a deal for four more games for multiple platforms. NEON started work on the PC role-playing game Vanished Powers (eventually unreleased) and completed the action game Tunnel B1 in 1996. Shortly after the release Ocean ran into financial difficulties and was acquired by Infogrames (now Atari). Some payments to NEON were still due and the studio was forced to lay off about 20 people. In a dispute with the other four founders Büttner and Wiederwach left the company. Büttner moved on to X-ample Architectures where Viper was completed for Ocean in 1998. NEON took a different direction. After completing Mars Taxi (1997) the studio focused on mostly licensed Game Boy Color games for different publishers such as Janosch (1999), Pumuckls Abenteuer bei den Piraten (1999), Tabaluga (1999), Maya the Bee: Garden Adventures (2000), Pumuckls Abenteuer im Geisterschloss (2000), Die Maus: Verrückte Olympiade (2001), Santa Claus Junior (2001), and Santa Claus Jr. Advance (2002 - GBA), but also titles like the action shooter Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. (1999) and the BMX game Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX (2000). The company was purchased by JoWooD in 2000. Triebel left in 2003 and went on to co-found the development studio ZEAL GmbH. NEON's last title was the PS2 game Legend of Kay (2005). JoWood ran into financial difficulties and in late 2005 NEON was closed and all developers were let go. Former employees went on to work at other German developers and some founded the German studio 49Games GmbH. The three remaining owners, Christoulakis, Jöckel, and Thierolf, founded keen games GmbH & Co. KG in 2005 with some other developers.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/3ceadc4e-bc7f-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1994,2015,Germany

The company was originally known for its humorous games, such as the Earthworm Jim series, which spawned a successful line of action figures, comic books and a syndicated television cartoon series on the Universal Cartoon Studios/Warner Kids Network. Shiny was acquired by Interplay in 1995 and in the following five years they released MDK (1997), Wild 9 (1999), Messiah (2000) and Sacrifice (2000). The critics' acclaim for their titles was not always reflected in the sales numbers, and in 2002 the company was acquired by Infogrames (later Atari), which meant a drastic change for the company's focus. Shiny released two games based on the Matrix films franchise: Enter the Matrix (2003) and The Matrix: Path of Neo. Although less polished than their previous games, those were Shiny's biggest successes. In February 2006, Atari announced to restructure and sell Shiny. Founder David Perry resigned to spend more time raising interest for potential buyers, to rejoin afterwards. He announced to do this to avoid stepping on anybody's toes inside Atari, as he was also a member of various boards. Eventually, David Perry did not return to the company and started directing an MMORPG at Acclaim Games. In October 2006, Atari sold Shiny to Foundation 9 Entertainment. A year later, the company was merged with another studio of Foundation 9, The Collective. The merged studios were renamed into Double Helix Games.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/f99a5462-bc7c-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1994,2010,United States

Rideon Incorporated,,,2002,2025,
Ritual Entertainment,"The development studio was founded as Hipnotic Software in August 1996 and it is based in Dallas, Texas (2006). One of the founders was Tom Mustaine. Their first title was Quake Mission Pack No. I: Scourge of Armagon (1997), the first official expansion pack to id Software's Quake. In June 1997, the name was changed to Ritual Entertainment, and their first standalone title was SiN (1998), a first-person shooter based on the id Tech 2 engine and set in a sci-fi environment. It was followed by the expansion Wages of Sin (1999) created together with 2015, Inc. In 2000 two more games were released: the third-person platformer Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K. 2 and the third game in the Blair Witch series: Blair Witch: Volume III - The Elly Kedward Tale. Their next game was Star Trek: Elite Force II (2003), a sequel to Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force by Raven Software. Ritual started work on Counter-Strike: Condition Zero in December 2002, the single player version of the popular Counter-Strike multiplayer title, after both Rogue Entertainment and Gearbox Software had taken on the project but did not complete it. A few months later, a second team at Ritual began work porting Half-Life: Counter-Strike to the Xbox (using updated assets from Condition Zero), shipping that product in November 2003. However, the review copies of the finished Condition Zero game received negative feedback and in the summer of 2003 Valve decided to hand the project to Turtle Rock Studios. Turtle Rock went on to develop a completely different game, including Ritual's missions as Deleted Scenes in the retail version released in 2004. That same year, Ritual released the Team Sabre expansion pack to Novalogic's Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. The studio's final game as an independent studio was SiN Episodes: Emergence, another take on the SiN shooter franchise envisioned as a series of episodic downloads through Valve's Steam distribution service along with retail copies. Ritual had nine instalments planned, but that came to a halt after just one episode when the studio was acquired by the casual game development studio MumboJumbo in January 2007. The response to the SiN Episodes project was underwhelming, barely breaking even financially, and several key employees had already left the company prior to the acquisition. Steve Nix left to become the director of business development at id Software, vice president and co-founder Tom Mustaine went to work on the now-canned esports title Severity for the now defunct Cyberathlete Professional League. Level designer John Schuch went to 3D Realms and QA manager Michael Russell also left. After the acquisition, community relations manager Steve Hessel moved on to Splash Damage. Already before the acquisition, Ken Harward had been appointed the new company director. MumboJumbo's CEO Mark Cottam explained the other episodes were not completely shelved, but Ritual was hired to create high-quality casual games, not to enter the more mainstream market. Before the acquisition Ritual had also contributed assets to 25 to Life (2006) and created the Übertools for id Software's id Tech 3, which were licensed to several other developers. Since then, the only major title Ritual has contributed to is Electronic Arts Los Angeles' Medal of Honor: Airborne (2007). The team has been integrated entirely into MumboJumbo and no longer operates as a division within the company. Ritual's unreleased projects include a PC version of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and a demo/prototype of SiN 2 (2003).",https://cdn.mobygames.com/129a9f98-ab6c-11ed-beab-02420a000199.webp,1997,2009,United States

Songbird Productions,"Songbird Productions was founded in 1999 by well-known Atari fan and hobby developer Carl Forhan to develop and publish games for all Atari consoles, from the 2600 to the Jaguar.  Carl does develop directly for the Lynx and Jaguar and a primary emphasis of Songbird Productions is to finish up those games and get them out the door and into consumers' hands.  However, equally important is the opportunity to work with other hobby developers, who may have the skill to develop a beta-quality game but need some help in certain areas (audio, graphics, playtest, etc.) or even a release-quality game, but don't have the contacts or funds necessary to get a game published for an Atari system. Songbird Productions has the skills and contacts necessary to release games for virtually any Atari console. http://www.songbird-productions.com/about.shtml",https://cdn.mobygames.com/269e3f72-bc83-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1999,2025,

Black Isle Studios,"Black Isle Studios is a development division of developer and publisher Interplay. Originally formed in 1996, it started using the name in 1998 and it was based in California, USA. The division's name refers to Black Isle in Scotland, the native country of founder Feargus Urquhart. The studio was a continuation of Interplay's DragonPlay, not a real division with a dedicated group of people, but rather a name used to introduce RPGs. Black Isle Studios continued this by solely focusing on RPGs. The company established and worked on 2 major franchises: Fallout and Icewind Dale. Other games are Planescape: Torment and Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader (although mainly the work of Reflexive Entertainment Inc). Next to in-house projects, Black Isle also aided in the development of BioWare's Baldur's Gate series. There was one game in the series they developed by themselves, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II (2004 - Xbox/PS2) The division was closed on 8th December 2003, when they were working on Fallout 3 (codenamed Van Buren, unrelated to the Fallout 3 that would release in 2008). Three more titles had been cancelled earlier: Stonekeep II (2001), Black Isle's Torn (2001) and Baldur's Gate 3: The Black Hound (2003). Many of the employees moved on to Obsidian Entertainment and inXile Entertainment. On 22 August 2012, the studio's website was relaunched, along with the brand. However, the revived brand had nothing to do with the former Black Isle, except for Mark O'Green and Chris Taylor, two former members of the Black Isle. Black Isle was shut down once again in early 2014, probably because of insufficient funds, with all of the employees having left the company to find employment elsewhere, thus leading to the cancellation of Project V13, the only project that the new team was working on, which was a successor to Fallout Online, a scrapped MMO set in Fallout universe. The company was launched for a third time by 2021, when Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II ports for PC and newer consoles were to be released.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/8418a1f2-bc82-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1998,2019,United States

Digital Image Design Ltd.,"Digital Image Design was a game development studio established in 1989 by Martin Kenwright and Phillip Allsopp from a bedroom in a small house in Runcorn, England. Originally known as Piercingautomatic Limited, it was soon renamed Digital Image Design. The company developed titles for both PC and console. DID was best known for 3D games at a time where very few games used similar technology. After some titles such as F29 Retaliator (1989), RoboCop 3 (1992) and Epic (1992), the company worked exclusively on flight simulation products with titles such as TFX (1993), EF 2000 (1995), F22 Air Dominance Fighter (1997) and Total Air War (1998). Its reputation landed the company the opportunity to compete in the area of military training simulations for the Royal Air Force, British Army and Royal Navy. In 1997 the company received the BS EN ISO 9001 code TickIT certification to develop military simulations. Real fighter pilots were training using derivatives of DID's gaming software. The company ended up in a major dispute with the French company Infogrames, who had acquired DID's publisher Ocean Software in 1996. The French company being the sole publisher and shareholder launched an aggressive takeover to gain control of the company and ultimately acquired DID. Martin Kenwright, along with six other early founders and key employees of DID, left to form Evolution Studios in June 1999, to develop driving games for Sony. Only three months after Martin Kenwright's departure, there was a mass walkout of DID staff to Rage Software. The company was then sold to Rage after Infogrames threatened with legal action for contractual interference by Rage. In 2003, after the demise of Rage, many of the original key staff members of Digital Image Design formed Juice Games (later called THQ Digital Studios UK and now closed), and many others left to join Evolution Studios.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/ccc5c932-bc7a-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1989,2019,United Kingdom

Southlogic Studios,"The Brazilian development studio Southlogic Studios was founded in July of 1996 by Christian Lykawka, in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul. During its first year of operation, Southlogic Studios produced a 2D platform shooter game called Guimo. It was published in Brazil and Europe in 1997.  After that, the company went into hibernation for a year, until Christian had the opportunity to join an ""incubation"" program for new companies at UFRGS (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul). Christian took advantage of this opportunity by laying out a long-term plan for creating a proprietary 3D engine.  Thus, in 1998, the Aspen Engine’ was born, a full-fledged development environment that includes an object-oriented game engine, a 3D MAX exporter, and a level editing tool. The engine handles all of the graphics, physics, sound, networking, etc., allowing applications to be easily built on top of it. To prove the technology's worth, a prototype for a game called Aquarius was developed concurrently, as a multiplayer combination of action and strategy. It combined typical real-time-strategy elements such as tech trees and resource collection with the ability to enter and control any unit as in a first-person shooter. In early 2001, the engine was finished and Southlogic Studios produced the Jungle Demo, which proved that it was possible to create a dense jungle environment in a videogame, on a scale never before seen. The demo attracted the attention of Infogrames, Inc. and Southlogic was asked to make another prototype, this time for a hunting simulation, to show Infogrames how the Aspen Engine technology could be applied to a hunting game.  Infogrames then contracted Southlogic Studios to create a hunting game using that outdoor technology, which became Trophy Hunter 2003 (2002). In 2002, the company also doubled in size and created the game in only eight months, on time and on budget. Since then, Southlogic has created two more hunting games: Deer Hunter 2004 (2003) and Deer Hunter 2005 (2004). In 2006, for the World Cup Football 2006, they created the football game Football Tigers, aimed at a young audience, for Kellogs/Microtime. Southlogic also outsources art and technology to various publishers and developers. They did the graphics for the Xbox game Hummer: Badlands (2004) and ported Xiaolin Showdown (2006) to the Xbox. Art assets were provided for Dora the Explorer: Journey to the Purple Planet (2005 - PS2/GameCube), Curious George (2006 - PS2/Xbox/GameCube/Windows), Scooby-Doo!: Who's Watching Who? (2006 - PSP) and Flushed Away (2006 - PS2). The studio also contributed to the movie Meu tio matou um cara (2004). On 20th January 2008 Ubisoft Entertainment SA announced to have acquired the company. At that time, the team consisted of about 20 developers. The studio was integrated into Ubisoft São Paulo, with Southlogic management reporting to Bertrand Chaverot, managing director of Ubisoft's Brazilian studio. Southlogic, however, kept its facilities in Porto Alegre, operating as a satellite office.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/65740840-bc78-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1997,2009,Brazil

"Gunfire Games, LLC","Gunfire Games is a game development studio based in Texas, USA. It was formed by David Adams who was previously CEO at Crytek USA, along with a group of lead developers from Crytek. A downscaling at Crytek USA was reported at the end of July 2014. The team was working on the action game HUNT: Horrors of the Gilded Age, announced only a month before, and development on that title was moved to the Frankfurt Crytek studio in Germany. The US studio's activities were from then on to be limited to managing sales of CryEngine licenses. Adams resigned the same day. The game was eventually released as Hunt: Showdown in 2018. Crytek USA was also said to be chronically under-funded and Adams wished to take matters in his own hands without having to rely on a larger governing entity. The formation of Crytek USA came about very quickly in a bid to acquire Vigil Games in THQ's bankruptcy auctions, as no one had put forward a bid. Adams was the co-founder of Vigil and was with the company until it was closed following publisher THQ's bankruptcy in December 2012. Before that, he worked at NCSoft and a group of NCSoft developers joined Vigil Games. Vigil was best known for the Darksiders games. In its early years (2015-2017), Gunfire made 6 VR titles: Herobound: First Steps (2015), Herobound: Spirit Champion (2016), Herobound Gladiators (2016) together with Escalation Studios, Chronos (2016), Dead and Buried (2016) and From Other Suns (2017). Returning to its Vigil roots, the studio approached Nordic Games that held the Darksiders licence and made Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition (2015) and a third title Darksiders III in 2018. On 14 August 2019, they were acquired by THQ Nordic. Gunfire launched its own major IP with the action RPG Remnant: From the Ashes (2019), followed by Chronos: Before the Ashes (2020), a remastered version of the prequel Chronos from 2016. The sequel Remnant II was released in 2023.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/7e50c182-ab6b-11ed-ac16-02420a000199.webp,2015,2023,United States

Special FX Software Ltd.,"Special FX was a software house based in Liverpool, UK. It was founded in 1987 by Paul Finnegan and Jonathan ""Joffa"" Smith after they left Ocean Software. They were soon joined by other developers from Ocean and Imagine. At its largest, Special FX included Finnegan, Smith, Andy Rixon, Karen Davies, Robbie Tinman, Jim Bagley, Keith Robinson and Ian Moran. As Ocean had been developing most of their games in-house until then, Special FX sought to become an independent game development contractor. Not keen to lose their talent, Ocean offered a deal that allowed them to option publishing rights to any game developed by Special FX. Hysteria, the first game Special FX created, would also be the only one not to be published by Ocean in Europe: Ocean kept relying on them for the development of several games, mainly movie licensees and arcade conversions. After a few years of activity, Ocean took over the financial reins of the company, until in 1991 they decided to fold it. Later that year, Finnegan established Rage Software with several former members of Special FX.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/7b90e1a6-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1987,1991,

Wargaming Chicago-Baltimore,"Wargaming West is a US development studio originally founded as Meyer/Glass Interactive (sometimes abbreviated M/GI) in 1997 by Steven Meyer as a division of Meyer/Glass Design, one of the most prolific toy invention design firms in the industry. The division was created to develop games for the Xbox, Sony PlayStation, and PC gaming platforms and their two studios were located in Chicago, Illinois, and Hunt Valley, Maryland. Mr. Meyer sold the M/GI division in 2001 to industry veterans Denny Thorley, Mike McDonald, and T. J. Wagner who renamed it Day 1 Studios. The new independent company kept the two existing studios and added another location in Seattle, Washington. Day 1 Studios' first project was MechAssault, which became a successful franchise for the company, and proved useful to Microsoft in promoting their Xbox Live service as the game was bundled with subscriptions for some time. In 2008, the company reported having 135+ engineers, designers and artists. They announced in February 2012 to be working on a new mech game Reign of Thunder, which was presumably cancelled. On 29th January 2013 Wargaming.net announced the acquisition of the company for $20 million.

Appeal Studios S.A.,"Appeal is a Belgian game development studio formed by Yves Grolet, Franck Sauer and Yann Robert in the summer of 1995. The three had previously been working together on coin-op games at Art & Magic. The studio was founded with the purpose to create a blockbuster title based on new technology. They quickly teamed up with the French publishing house Infogrames and began work on their first title. Much of the development was spent on technology. Appeal focused on voxel-based graphics, opposed to Direct3D-accelerated graphics which required a separate 3D card. They also created an advanced AI system called GAIA and the graphics/sound rendering API Paradise. Most of that technology was tested in the 1997 game No Respect, a futuristic flying shooter that was met with mediocre reviews. It was only a side project for a flagship title they were working on, the action/adventure game Outcast released in July 1999. Although running at a low resolution of 512x384, the non-linear gameworld, the orchestrated music and the attention to the lush environment, story and general atmosphere brought praise to the game, also the first title of Belgian origin to make such an impact worldwide. The game sold 400,000 copies, but this was not as much as Infogrames had hoped, killing off the Dreamcast port and chances for an enhanced Windows version supporting 3D acceleration. Appeal began work on a sequel, Outcast 2: The Lost Paradise, for Windows and the PlayStation 2. The general game design would be similar, but to appeal to a broader audience more arcade-like changes were announced, such as more action and stealth, taking away a slice from the adventure portion of the game. In 2002, a release date around 2003-2004 was proposed. The company was however struggling, as Yves Grolet and several other members had already left in 2000. Development did not move on as planned, and publisher Infogrames put the game on hold. Appeal also spent time on the pre-production of a title based on the Belgian comics icon Tintin, but eventually, in August 2002, the company declared its bankruptcy. The spirit of Appeal lived on in the development studio elseWhere Entertainment SPRL, founded in 2001 by the former Appeal member Yves Grolet. elseWhere also focused on new technology first and made plans to develop the real sequel to Outcast, but Infogrames held on to its intellectual property, causing the developers to create an entirely new universe, but with a similar feel. The spiritual sequel (Project Alpha) as well as a racing game (Project Beta) were never released and elseWhere went on to join the 10tacle group in 2005 where it worked on entirely different games. The other two founders, Yann Robert and Franck Sauer, went on to establish the development studio Fresh3D S.A.R.L. in the summer of 2004. The studio was relaunched by the three original founders in 2015. In 2014, the updated game Outcast 1.1 had already been released. The complete remake Outcast: Second Contact was released in 2017 despite a failed crowd funding campaign through Kickstarter. In January 2019, THQ Nordic announced the acquisition of the Outcast IP and in May 2021 Embracer Group AB, the parent company of THQ Nordic, announced the acquisition of the entire studio. Since then, the studio has worked on a variety of games, from smaller licensed titles such as Fort Boyard (2019), The Bluecoats: North & South (2020) and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (2020), to more ambitious projects such as the squad based Gangs of Sherwood (2023) based on the legend of Robin Hood. However, most of the resources were pooled into the development of the long awaited Outcast sequel Outcast: A New Beginning, released in March 2024.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/21bcee90-bc83-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,1997,2024,Belgium

Deadline Games A/S,"History according to Chris Mottes (CEO): Deadline's history is not the classic story of a development company started by five computer-science students in a garage...  In contrast, Deadline was a professional, internationally recognised television production company when, in 1996, the company's Creative Director, Simon Jon Andreasen, became insistent that it was time to fulfill our (secret) dream of producing games.  Since we both were secret gamers (not very cool at the time) I agreed that we should invest in starting a games department. The rapid spread of the multimedia PC and PlayStation heralded the spreading of games beyond the realm of teenage boys and into the mass market. It also signalled that this was our last chance to enter the market at a time when the barriers of entry where reasonable. In the course of just six months, the company's new games division grew from 3 to 15 employees, and within a year it was obvious that the prevailing drive in the company was to produce games rather than television programs. In 1997, Deadline joined forces with TATI, a Swedish company, to form a developer-owned publishing company, Vision Park Entertainment AB. The television division was sold and our focus was now set 100% on games and interactive entertainment. At Vision Park, I (Chris Mottes) sat on the Board of Directors and worked as Vice President of Internal Development, responsible for building our development department up to include 130 people, spread out in four games development studios, one online entertainment studio, one Corporate advertainment/infotainment studio and an Interactive TV studio in locations in Oslo, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Copenhagen. I remained in this role as a member of the management team of Vision Park until March 2001, taking the company public and expanding it from thirty employees, with a turnover of £3 million, to one hundred and seventy employees, with a turnover of £20 million.  Vision Park exclusively distributed games throughout Scandinavia during this period for several major international games publishers including Codemasters, Eidos, Activision, InterPlay, Virgin, Empire, Blue Byte, Aviva and SCI. In March 2001, Creative Director Simon Andreasen and I decided to carry out a management takeover of our old studio, Deadline Games. We did this because we wanted to move on to make AAA titles for the consoles that clearly are the future of gaming.  Today, Deadline has two major business areas:  Our Games department is dedicated to games development on all platforms for the world market. Our aim is to keep creating highly original titles and to shape the future of interactive entertainment.  Our Corporate department develops hi-tech, tailor-made business-to-business solutions for interactive marketing, learning, testing and visualisation products for a range of customers. By re-using technologies and concepts from our Games department we can deliver products that have a huge added-value to our customer since they can include the highest standards of interactivity available for a fraction of the original development costs. Deadline Games facts:   Number of productions: 8 full-price PC games & 3 Corporate PC products.   Employees: 60 hard-working men and women.   Production lines: 2.   Technology: 2D isometric MUH Works and 3D real-time KAPOW Systems 3D. Playstation 2 and Microsoft Xbox developer status.   Present and former partners: Warner Bros, EA, Ubisoft, Valusoft, Tivola, Pan Vision, Living Books, Vision Park, BMG Interactive, Bonnier Multimedia, Danish Centre for Human Rights, Nordea Bank, Jyske Bank, Advertising agency Nørgård Mikkelsen, Danmarks Kirkelige Mediecenter (publisher of material for the Danish Lutheran Church).   Owners: Chris Mottes (CEO), Simon Jon Andreasen (Creative Director), shareholders and employees. In January 2009 the studio announced that the title Faith and a .45 had been put on hold indefinitely. It was a story about two outlaws set during the Great Depression. Because no publisher could be founded, it became too costly to finish it in time.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/f75906c4-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1997,2023,Sweden

GRIN AB,"The development studio GRIN was founded by brothers Bo and Ulf Andersson in 1997 in Sweden. The studio's headquarters were in Stockholm. The company's first release was Ballistics (2001 - PC, Arcade), the first game ever to use pixel-shaders. Next, the team created Bandits - Phoenix Rising (2002 - PC) and several arcade machines, as well as Military and Civilian simulators. All of its titles were powered by the proprietary, in-house developed DIESEL engine, which was also offered for licensing. Bugbear Entertainment used it for its FlatOut racing game and Fatshark AB, a studio partially owned by GRIN, used it to create the shooter Lead & Gold: Gangs of the Wild West. The company also had a quality assurance studio in Indonesia. GRIN went on to develop two games for Ubisoft. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter (2006 - PC) and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 (2007 - PC) are both tactical games continuing the Ghost Recon franchise with separate games for the Windows platform. In 2009 the company saw heavy layoffs, likely to the weaker-than-expected sales of three titles completed in the first half of the year: Wanted: Weapons of Fate, Terminator: Salvation and Bionic Commando (a heavily enhanced remake of the classic Bionic Commando). In May it was first reported more than 200 staff (about 50% of the workforce) had been let go from the Stockholm, Gothenburg and Barcelona offices. In June it was reported both the Barcelona and Gothenburg had been closed, with the Stockholm employees told not to come to work. On 12th August the company was officially closed. The Andersson founders cited an unbearable cashflow situation in their goodbye statement, blaming delayed payments by too many publishers. It also contained a reference to an unreleased title the studio was working on. Prior to the closure about 25 ex-employees founded the development studio Outbreak Studios. In April 2010 a new studio was announced, Might and Delight, based around a small group of the GRIN team that worked on Bionic Commando Rearmed. A third studio with former GRIN employees, Whiteout, was announced in August 2010. The two Andersson brothers founded the game development studio Overkill Software in 2009.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/957d7c32-bc79-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,2001,2011,Sweden

"Rainmaker Entertainment, Inc.","Mainframe Entertainment, founded in 1993, was one of the leading companies in the area of CG animation for television, direct-to-video DVD, theatrical feature films, interactive games and commercials, with offices in Vancouver (Mainframe Vancouver) and Los Angeles (Mainframe USA). The company worked on well-known international brands such as Barbie, Hot Wheels, Spider-Man, Casper and Popeye. Its claim to fame, however, was its production of the pioneering CGI animated series ReBoot (which spawned the PSX game ReBoot, as well as the acclaimed Transformers spin-off Beast Wars (also made into a game called Beast Wars: Transformers. In 2006, US-based IDT Entertainment, which held a 62% majority stake in Mainframe, sold the company to another major Canadian player in the digital entertainment market, Rainmaker. After the merger, the team was integrated in the new company as a new division, Rainmaker Animation.

Vlambeer,"Vlambeer (Dutch for ""bear in flames"" or ""bear on fire"") is the independent studio of the Dutch developer Jan Willem Nijman. It was established on 1st September 2010. At first it consisted of Rami Ismail as well. During most of Vlambeer's history, Nijman was the main designer and Ismail was focused on programming and the business development. Initially they made flash games to gather funds for their own projects. These commissioned titles were tagged as developed by ""Not Vlambeer"" and often do not include traces of the Vlambeer names of the developers. Examples of these are Radical Fishing (2010, for Bored.com) and Dinosaur Zookeeper (2011, for Adult Swim). The developers often prototype new ideas and release them to get feedback from players. The first title released using the studio name was the freeware shooter Super Crate Box (2010). The team also made one of the three promotional indie games for Serious Sam 3: BFE (2011). Their take is called Serious Sam: The Random Encounter and it was released in October 2011. Other major titles by the studio are Ridiculous Fishing (2013), Gun Godz (2013), Nuclear Throne (2013) and Luftrausers (2014) all for a wide variety of platforms. After ten years, on 1st September 2020, the studio announced the upcoming Ultrabugs would be the studio's last title after which the studio will close its doors. On 4th April 2024 Nijman announced he bought Ismail's shared and was now the sole owner of the studio. He also stated wanting to preserve the classic Vlambeer games, and make sure they get the maintenance they need to stay playable far into the future.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/2dd585b6-bc7e-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,2010,2023,Netherlands

Warp Inc.,"Warp Inc. is a Japanese development studio founded by Kenji Eno in 1994. It is a continuation of his earlier work at his studio Eim Ltd. The company first approached The 3DO Company to work on games. Next to the titles credited here, the company also created Totsugeki Kikan! Megadasu!! (1994 - also appears to be known as Totsugeki Karakuri Megadasu!!), Trip'd (1995) and Oyaji Hunter Mahjong (1995), Short Warp (1996), Enemy Zero (1997), Real Sound: Kaze no Regret (1997 - a game without any visuals) and D-2 (1999). The company got known mostly through the D series. Real Sound was also envisioned as a franchise, but although a sequel was announced, it was never produced. D-2 was the company's last game due to troubled relations with SEGA where it was a second party developer. Another game was in development, but never completed. Eventually the company was renamed Superwarp and intended to enter the IT business, but that never took off. The company appears to have been closed eventually.

attic Entertainment Software GmbH,"Attic was a German software developer founded in 1989 and closed in 2001. Attic was founded by Hans-Jürgen Brändle, Jochen Hamma and Guido Henkel in the German town of Albstadt. All were equal partners in terms of ownership over the company. The company's logo showed the silhouette of a bat and was probably chosen in accordance with the name because -- like many other IT-firms -- the company started out with a small number of people working in their own home which then grew into a fully-fledged business. The ""golden"" years The young company collaborated with Starbyte Software (another now defunct German software company) who owned the license of Germany's most popular pen-and-paper RPG ""Das Schwarze Auge"" (""The Dark Eye""). This lead to Attic developing the famous ""Nordlandtrilogie"" (""Northlandtriolgy""), known outside Germany as ""Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny"", ""Realms of Arkania: Star Trail"" and ""Realms of Arkania: Shadows over Riva"", a series of computer role-playing games based upon said franchise. The games were very successful, received good press reviews and were also translated internationally which is how a bigger audience than just the German RPG players was able to dwell in the world of Aventuria. Breaking up In a 2002 interview with German magazine ""PC Games"", Guido Henkel said that he had grown tired of making the same kind of game over and over again while the other members wanted to keep ""milking"" the popular ""The Dark Eye"" brand since they still saw potential profit in it. Due to the high cost of licensing the brand, the company barely made a profit on the games although they sold well. This lead to a disagreement about the company's strategy. Soon after Guido Henkel left Attic the company was said to ""go downhill"". Where are they now?  Guido Henkel left Attic for the USA were he met his future wife and focused on making games for mobile devices with his own company G3Studios. Hans-Jürgen Brändle passed away in 2005 in Las Vegas. Jochen Hamma still works in the games industry as a consultant, teacher and project leader. He educates students at the Berlin-based Games Academy and was the project leader on Spellbound Studios' PC games ""Desperados 2"" and its stand-alone Add-on ""Helldorado"".  The attic company website (www.attic.de) is now defunct and redirects to www.fantastic-realms.com which is hosted and owned by Jochen Hamma. The future of ""The Dark Eye"" As of 2006, a PC RPG based on ""The Dark Eye"" is being produced by German developer Radon Labs in Berlin. The game ""Das Schwarze Auge: Drakensang"" is considered to be the unofficial successor or sequel to the aforementioned trilogy and would be the fourth computer game based on the pen-and-paper RPG.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/21c6f574-bc75-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1990,2009,Germany

Bugbear Entertainment Oy,"Bugbear Entertainment is an independent game development studio located in Helsinki, Finland. The company was founded in March 2000 by Janne Alanenpää, Tatu Blomberg and a number of friends. It was initially funded by one of the producers / designers (Alanenpää's neighbour) at Carts Entertainment, a company that was closed soon after the release of Thrust Twist + Turn in 1999 and they still own Bugbear to this day. Many of the initial people at Bugbear knew each other since they were teenagers and worked together as the demoscene group Byterapers. Bugbear exclusively creates racing games and its first release was Rally Trophy for JoWooD in 2001. The first game the studio worked on was Hat Trick Hockey, not a racing game, but it was never released. After Tough Trucks: Modified Monsters in 2003, the studio became best known for the FlatOut arcade racing series. They released FlatOut in 2004, FlatOut 2 in 2006 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage in 2007. When the franchise's publisher Empire Interactive collapsed, the rights to the series were lost and sold to Strategy First who had other development studios create further games in the series. Meanwhile Bugbear had also created Glimmerati for N-Gage in 2005 and on the PSP SEGA Rally Revo for SEGA in 2007. Bugbear then turned its racing expertise to the Ridge Racer series for Namco Bandai Games. They created Ridge Racer Unbounded (2012) as well as the free-to-play game Ridge Racer Driftopia (2013). In February 2013 Next Car Game was announced, a new racing title and the first independent release for the studio. After launching a tentative funding initiative in September, they launched a full Kickstarter crowd funding campaign in November. As the $350,000 goal would not be reached, they cancelled the campaign at the end of the month and took it to the Steam distribution portal where it was released in the Early Access program. It was released fully in 2018 as Wreckfest. On 14 November 2018, Bugbear Entertainment was acquired by THQ Nordic.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/c7962014-05c6-11f0-b018-02420a000127.webp,2001,2025,Finland

From 2007 to 2012, the company was involved in a legal battle with Epic Games, with Silicon Knights claiming they withheld features and documentation of Unreal Engine 3 from licensees so that Epic could focus on their own games while gaining income from external licenses. Epic Games quickly countersued Silicon Knights for attempts at making changes to the engine and presented it as their own, contrary to the license agreement. Epic would ultimately win the case, and Silicon Knights would have to pay US$ 4.45 million.

Simutronics Corporation,"Simutronics Corporation was founded in 1987. Incorporated in Virginia, Simutronics has offices in the St. Louis, Missouri and Washington, DC areas with more than 300 employees and contractors around the world. The company is privately held. Simutronics is one of the pioneers of the multiplayer online gaming experience. The company started off with GemStone II on GEnie, in the late 80's, which quickly evolved into GemStone III, a pay for play MUD type game. Their next game was CyberStrike which became Game of the Year in 1993 as an online graphical ""mech"" game, the first of its type. Simutronics capitalized on its Interactive Fiction Engine that ran GemStone III by developing DragonRealms, Modus Operandi (in partnership with Time-Warner) and Hercules and Xena: Alliance of Heroes. Many of these games continue to be available at Simutronics' web site (www.play.net), and have loyal fans. In 1998, Simutronics made its foray into 3D accelerated games by teaming with Publisher 989 (soon to be Verant Interactive / Sony) and putting out CyberStrike 2, a mech game that recreated the excitement of the original game. The latest in the Gemstone saga is GemStone IV, which they state is ""the longest-running text-based game in the industry"". Their current project is Hero's Journey, a 3D massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG).",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d155b868-bc7f-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1988,2022,United States

"Turtle Rock Studios, Inc.","Turtle Rock Studios is a US game development studio founded in March 2002 by Michael Booth. The company initially worked on several Counter-Strike versions independently. These include the Xbox version (2003), the reworked Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (2004) and various maps for Counter-Strike: Source (2004). Booth was also responsible for the game's official AI bot. On 20 November 2006, the studio announced its first entirely original title, the co-op multiplayer shooter Left 4 Dead. On 10 January 2008, the studio was acquired by Valve Corporation and renamed Valve South. The team worked together with the main Valve team to complete the game. It was released in November 2008. In June 2009, it was confirmed Valve South no longer operated as an office. Several members moved to Bellevue, Washington including Booth. The sequel Left 4 Dead 2, released in November 2009, was developed entirely by the main Valve development team without involvement of Valve South. On 5th February 2010 the studio's website was relaunched and new owners Chris Ashton and Phil Robb announced to have reformed the company once again as Turtle Rock Studios with the remaining developers. In June 2010 the establishment of Turtle Rock Garage was announced, a division focused on casual and experimental games for platforms such as iPhone, Facebook and Xbox Live. On 26th May 2011 THQ announced to have signed the studio's next major title. Described as a shooter, THQ first revealed the game's name as Wild in June 2011. In March 2012, THQ trademarked the name Evolve, and it was later revealed Evolve is most likely the new name for the project. When THQ closed down in January 2012 and auctioned off its portfolio, Take-Two Interactive Software purchased the publishing rights for $11 million. Turtle Rock attempted to buy the IP as well, but its $250,000 offer was outbid by Take-Two.

Lobotomy Studios,"Lobotomy Software was an American game development studio especially known for Powerslave (Exhumed in Europe) and their SEGA Saturn ports of Quake and Duke Nukem 3D. The studio was established in 1993 with a number of former employees of Nintendo of America for the creative side and from Manley & Associates for the engineering side. It originally operated out of the apartment of co-founder Paul Lange. Lobotomy was eventually acquired by Crave Entertainment in 1998 and renamed Lobotomy Studios. The team worked on a Caesar's Palace gambling game on the Nintendo 64, but after a year of development the game was postponed and eventually cancelled. At that point Lobotomy Studios was closed and employees were let go or given the option to be relocated to another position at Crave. The next title the team would have worked on was a sequel to Powerslave. Crave did however not acquire all talent with the takeover in 1998. Some employees chose not to make the transition, including Ezra Dreisbach (creator of Death Tank) who went on to find work at Snowblind Studios and currently works at Flat Games.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/1ef0869a-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1994,2022,United States

Pieces Interactive AB,"Pieces Interactive was a game development company situated in Skövde, a small city in the midst of Sweden. The company was founded in 2007 by 9 people. The company's history goes back several years prior to starting the business, as a team of former students graduating from Sweden's game development educations. The company's first title was a puzzle game called Puzzlegeddon, released in November of 2008. The studio experimented with several different games within a multitude of genres, including Fret Nice, Leviathan: Warships, Kill to Collect: Gid Gud and Die Trying and Magicka 2. After being acquired by THQ Nordic GmbH in August 2017, the studio developed two expansions for the hack n' slash action RPG Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition, as well as the second reboot of Alone in the Dark. The studio was closed on 17 June 2024.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/8d10a6a0-2cb2-11ef-a6ac-02420a0001c2.webp,2008,2024,Sweden

Piranha Bytes GmbH,"The company was founded as Piranha Bytes Software GmbH in 1997 in Germany. The team became known internationally because of the Gothic and Risen RPG series. In 1999, the company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Phenomedia. The company itself is now defunct, but all the assets, trademarks and most of the staff were moved to Pluto 13 GmbH when it was founded in September 2002. Although Pluto 13 was now the actual company, Piranha Bytes was still used as a label and the moniker of the development studio. After the release of Gothic 3 in 2006, the development team split from JoWood, their publisher at the time. Pluto 13 and Piranha Bytes now no longer own the name Gothic and the franchise itself, which was officially confirmed on 6th June 2007. The team went on to develop Risen, the spiritual successor to the Gothic series, which was released in 2009. The series was continued with two sequels Risen 2: Dark Waters in 2012 and Risen 3: Titan Lords in 2014. 2017 saw the release of the post-apocalyptic RPG Elex. In 2019, THQ Nordic fully acquired the company and reincorporated it into Piranha Bytes GmbH. On 8 July 2024, Polish video game news/review website CD-Action reported that the company ceased operations in June 2024.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/dab01dd8-c452-11ed-9112-02420a000138.webp,2001,2023,Germany

Malfador Machinations,"In 1993, Aaron Hall created Space Empires, a prototype space strategy game inspired by Star Fleet Battles, Master of Orion, Starfire, and Wing Commander. He decided that the prototype could be worth selling to the public if it were expanded upon, which led to the release of Space Empires II, and the establishment of Malfador Machinations in 1995. Development began on the next game, Space Empires III, with Aaron's long-time friend Russell Saito joining the company in 1996 as designer and artist. The game was released as shareware in 1997 and allowed players to customize their experience by editing graphics as well as data files to add or change technologies, ships, and planets. Following the success of SE III, work started on the sequel, Space Empires IV. The game was planned to have improved graphics as well as a redesigned interface, so new artists were brought on to the development team. Shrapnel Games, Inc. acquired the rights to publish SE IV in July 2000, and the game was released commercially in November of that year. Aaron Hall's Dungeon Odyssey, the company's first attempt at delivering a fantasy role-playing game, was released on 16 September 2002. This was followed up by Space Empires: Starfury, a free-roaming real-time 3D space combat game where the player controls only a single ship rather than an entire empire. In April 2006, Strategy First, Inc. acquired all intellectual property of Malfador Machinations before the release of Space Empires V in October that year. The game featured 3D graphics, hexagon grid system sectors, and an overhauled user interface. The company teamed up with Shrapnel Games, Inc. again for the November 2010 release of World Supremacy, a ""beer and pretzels"" turn-based strategy wargame set in contemporary times. Three years later, Space Captain, a top-down action role-playing game similar to Space Empires: Starfury was released for Android devices.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d471a67e-bc75-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1995,2020,

Midway Studios Australia,"Founded as Emergent Software in 1993, the company was renamed Ratbag in 1998 and was based in Adelaide, South Australia. Ratbag's first title Powerslide was released in 1998 and the studio has been focused on racing games ever since. Ratbag also owned the motion-capture studio Madcap in Sydney. Ratbag's titles were driven by the company's proprietary Difference Engine. This was the first PC engine to support unlimited textures and 60 frame per second high resolution graphics. The company's second title was Dirt Track Racing (1999), followed by Dirt Track Racing: Sprint Cars. World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002 was the title that marked Ratbag's first foray into the realm of PlayStation 2. WoOSC2002 was a racing title in the vein of Dirt Track Racing: Sprint Cars. It was released in Spring 2002 in the USA and May 2003 in Australia / New Zealand. Dirt Track Racing 2 and WoOSC were Ratbag's most recent PC titles, released in September 2002 and March 2003, respectively. They were preceded by Leadfoot and Dirt Track Racing Pinball. The Ratbag story is one of struggle and ultimately success. Greg Siegele and Richard Harrison spent three years and all of their personal savings developing the company's early technology. In 1996 they took the original Powerslide demo to E3, knowing that if no publishing deal were forthcoming the company would have to close its doors. The game received a lot of attention, and before they knew it Greg and Richard had no fewer than eight of the biggest publishers in the industry engaged in a bidding war for the rights. Coming full circle, Ratbag showcased Powerslide: Slipstream for PS2 at E3 2003. The studio was eventually acquired by Midway in August 2005 and renamed Midway Australia. A mere 4 months later, in December, it was shut down.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/619f69e8-bc74-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1998,2004,Australia

Pandemic Studio Pty Ltd,"Pandemic Studio Pty. Ltd. was the Australian satellite development studio of the US-based company Pandemic Studios. It was established in 2000 by Andrew Payne and Adam Iarossi who left the Los Angeles studio to the branch in the Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley. The studio was also referred to Pandemic Brisbane or Pandemic Australia. The team's first title was Army Men RTS (2002). Later, the division would work on the Destroy All Humans! franchise with the titles Destroy All Humans! (2005) and Destroy All Humans! 2 (2006). In November 2005, Pandemic as a whole formed an alliance with BioWare Corporation, backed financially by Elevation Partners. This also affected the Australian studio. Through the operation, a holding company called VG Holding Corp. was created. BioWare's two co-founders Greg Zeschuk and Ray Muzyka, and Pandemic's two co-founders Andrew Goldman and Josh Resnick, became shareholders and senior executives. John Riccitiello from Elevation became the company's CEO. On 11 October 2007, it was announced VG Holding Corp, including both BioWare and Pandemic, would be acquired by Electronic Arts, effective January 2008. On 7 January 2008, the company officially became a part of the EA Games label. THQ asked for a third Destroy All Humans! game in late 2006, but the Australian studio declined, preferring to work on new IP. On 23 October 2006, it was announced a second development team at the Australian studio was formed. The Alpha team began working on an open world Wii game tentatively called The Next Big Thing while the Bravo team pitched a number of concepts to the LA office. These were all rejected in favour of game similar to Destroy All Humans!, but playing as the son of Satan and collecting souls. With enthusiasm low for such similar game design, it was eventually canned. EA, however, had the rights for the Batman IP for another 18 months and the Bravo team started work on a game. After several months they were informed the game would need to be tied to the then upcoming The Dark Knight movie instead of the general franchise, meaning much work had to be scrapped. It was turned into an open world game, similar to the US studio's Mercenaries series, but the Australian team had no experience with such designs and the engine of The Saboteur they used, a then upcoming game of the US studio, was eventually deemed unfit for such large worlds. The enhancements and modifications they had to make put such pressure on the hardware it brought the dev kits to their knees. The team eventually grew to 130 people to get it done, but there was not enough time to meet the movie's release date. In September 2008, the game needed to go to an alpha stage, but was in such an unpolished state management decided to can the project entirely. Naturally the team size was reduced, but by December, Electronic Arts announced another major restructuring making the Australian team the main candidate. The Bravo team disappeared and the Australian studio was set ""free"", leaving the alpha team independent, but with the rights to the Wii game they were working on. As such, Pandemic Studios Pty. Ltd. as the Australian division of Pandemic Studios ceased to exist. The main Los Angeles studio would follow in December 2009, after the completion of The Saboteur. Lead designer Morgan Jaffit went on to found Defiant Development in 2010, which was closed in 2019.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/0ce9d176-c42c-11ed-846a-02420a000114.webp,2002,2023,Australia

They co-created the character Deathspank (2010) for Hothead Games and did some smaller titles together as Beep Games such as Word Spiral (2011), a new mobile version of the studio's 2006 title of the same name, as well as The Big Big Castle (2012) and Scurvy Scallywags (2013). In 2017 Voodoo Vince: Remastered was released as a remastered version of the studio's debut title and in 2020 a completely new action game Bartlow's Dread Machine was released, co-developed with Tribetoy Inc.

Bitmap Bureau Ltd.,"Bitmap Bureau is a UK development studio established in February 2016 by Mike Tucker and Matthew Cope. They are based in Southampton and several other members are spread across Europe. They are long time friends and previously worked together at Infospace Games - IOMO studio. Tucker in particular has a long history in the industry, starting with games testing at SCi Games Ltd. in 1995 and then the first mobile games at IOMO where he specialised in cross-platform mobile technology. Later he formed by studio Megadev focusing on high quality flash games and that studio developed Adult Swim's first Steam title, Super House of Dead Ninjas (2013). The studio develops fast action arcade game with a retro vibe and pixel art graphics. The word Bitmap in the studio name was chosen particularly because they want to get across their speciality in 2D games with strong pixel art, and the word ""pixel"" is already used by thousands of indie developers. The team debuted commercially with the 2D action platformer 88 Heroes in 2017. In the same year the local multiplayer action game Ninja Shodown was released. Before that, in 2016, they also created the homebrew SEGA Mega Drive title Fatal Smarties in 48 hours for a Global Game Jam, but not using the Bitmap Bureau name. For their third game, Xeno Crisis, they launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. It is a top-down arena shooter for up to two players described as Smash TV meets Aliens made a new title for the retro systems SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis and Dreamcast, both as a physical cartridge and a downloadable ROM. The project raised £72,569 and eventually the game was released in 2019 and for many platforms. The game was created on PC, with their own engine, and several custom tools they developed. It was then ported to the other platforms. In 2021 the studio released Battle Axe, developed together with Henk Nieborg and also following a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign raising £73,918.  In 2022 they released Final Vendetta, a 2D side-scrolling brawler inspired by Final Fight and Streets of Rage with music by Utah Saints. Just like Xeno Crisis, Final Vendetta was also announced as an original homecart release for the Neo Geo platform.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/f753914e-bc83-11ed-a23f-02420a000186.webp,2017,2025,United States

The production of “Hitchhiker”, however, marked a turning point towards a focus on high-quality narrative games for PC and console that contain a signature atmosphere of playfulness and surrealism.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/5d761038-ab6c-11ed-beab-02420a000199.webp,2010,2021,Germany

MicroProse Leeds,"As the name implies, this UK team concentrated mostly on games using mathematical methods of drawing screen displays. It was founded in June 1987 by former musician Andy Craven and Danny Gallagher. It was one of the notable studios writing for Activision's Electric Dreams label. One month after the formation the studio was landed a contract to do the Spectrum, Commodore and BBC Micro conversions of Star Wars. This was done by a development team of three people, as the founders hired 16-year-old programmer Ciaran Gultnieks. With a good result, the company received the contract to port Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back as well. Gallagher had already left for Ocean by then, but Derrick Austin, Bill Pullan, and Ian Martin joined the team. While working on the Empire project John Lewis also arrived, taking the role of company director and Gallagher's 50% share of the company. After that, the vector graphics were abandoned and the team moved on to an advanced 3D system of graphics. The company established a new sub-company Sprytes Ltd to create core systems for a wide array of games and platforms, and Muzik Ltd to do the same for music and sound effects. The first game to use the new graphics system was Strike Aces (Fighter Bomber in Europe) in 1989. After developing a number of original games the studio was acquired by Microprose in 1992. It then became Microprose's internal Leeds development studio.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/ff359528-bc75-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1987,2021,United States

Playdemic Ltd,"Playdemic is a games company based in Cheshire, United Kingdom and it is owned by Electronic Arts. It was established on 16 December 2009 in Manchester by Paul Gouge and Alex Rigby as a developer of social games, mainly for Facebook and later also for iOS and Android. Both founders had a history at Rockpool Games, a UK company creating content for mobile devices and other mobile companies before that. Rockpool was acquired by Eidos Interactive and in January 2009 confirmed to have been closed. Playdemic debuted with the social Facebook game Gourmet Garden in 2010, targeting women aged 35 to 50. Other social games released in the early years include Crossword Buddies (2012), Eye Spy! (2012), Village Life (2012) and Quiz Buddies (2013). The release of Gang Nations (2015) displayed other groups were targeted as well. In January 2011, Playdemic was acquired by RockYou and was renamed. At the time the studio employed sixteen people. Later that year RockYou faced financial instability and the studio performed a management buyout. The company was renamed Playdemic again. In 2012 it acquired the studio Ideas Pad based in Cheshire and they renamed it Playdemic Development. The two studios most likely moved into a single location as Playdemic's address became the Cheshire location. From then on Playdemic was always referred to as a single entity as Playdemic Ltd., even though both companies remained active. On 27 February 2013, the company announced that UK game pioneer Ian Livingstone was appointed company chairman as he was an angel investor in the studio. The company's biggest success is the social golf game Golf Clash (2017). By September 2018 revenue was estimated to have surpassed $225 million. On 8 February 2017, Tt Games (owned by Warner Bros.) announced the acquisition of the company with the goal of creating new LEGO titles for mobile devices. In 2019, the studio launched their first game LEGO Star Wars Battles co-developed with TT Odyssey for Warner Bros., but it never left the beta phase and was shut down on 1st July 2021. In the meantime the title was reworked by from a free-to-play title to a full game part of the Apple Arcade library and re-released in September 2021. In June 2021, Playdemic was purchased by Electronic Arts for $1.4 billion.

"Cryptic Studios, Inc.","Cryptic Studios, Inc., located in Los Gatos, California (USA) was established in June 2000 and was initially an independent developer of massively multiplayer online games for the PC and next generation consoles. Its first game, City of Heroes, was launched in April 2004. In October 2005, it launched the sequel City of Villains. In February 2008, Cryptic Studios announced that it was developing Champions Online, a high-action, totally customizable, superhero MMORPG based on the Champions role-playing game. It was released in September 2009. In November 2008, Cryptic Studios recruited Flagship Studios co-founder Bill Roper as Design Director and one month later, in December 2008, Atari announced to have acquired the company for 26.7 million dollar, along with a performance-linked deal. Ubisoft also wanted to acquire the company, but was beaten to the punch by Atari. The studio's first title developed for Atari was the MMORPG Star Trek Online. It was released in February 2010. In May 2011 Atari's financial results revealed that the studio was listed as ""discontinued operations"" and Atari said to be looking for a buyer. Support for Star Trek Online and Champions Online was continued, as well as work on a new title, Neverwinter. Atari stated to move on to fewer, but more profitable releases as well as expanding into mobile and casual games, and relying more on external development teams. It was announced a few weeks later that Cryptic had been acquired by Perfect World Entertainment (later Gearbox Publishing San Francisco). Despite revenues of €15.9 million over the last 12 months before the announcement, Cryptic still made a loss of €5.3 million. That was however an improvement over the €12.6 million loss of the year before. On 3 November 2023, the company laid off an undiscosed number of employees and was moved to the Deca Games division of the Embracer Group.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d2e22d66-acd3-11ee-8ecd-02420a000156.webp,2004,2021,United States
Crytek UK Limited,"Crytek UK was a development studio of Crytek GmbH and it was based in Nottingham, UK. The company was initially founded as Free Radical Design. After leaving developer Rare in February 1999, former GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark team members David Doak, Steve Ellis, Karl Hilton and Graeme Norgate began trading as independent development studio Free Radical Design a mere two months later in April 1999. The company was based in Sandiacre, Nottingham, England. With a team of only eighteen, Free Radical shipped and delivered the first-person shooter TimeSplitters to Eidos for the PS2 launch in October 2000. Over the years Free Radical Design received numerous awards and nominations including CTW Developer of the Year 2001, the Develop Industry Excellence award for Best Independent Development Studio in 2003, along with five BAFTA nominations for TimeSplitters 2 in 2004, and two BAFTA nominations for Second Sight in 2005. Furthermore, they were listed in the Sunday Times Tech Track 100 as one of the UK's fastest growing technology companies. The studio only developed first person shooter games. After the TimeSplitters series and Second Sight, the studio's final game was Haze (2008), which received mediocre to negative reviews. On 18 December 2008, the studio was reported closed, after the development of the next game for LucasArts, Star Wars: Battlefront III, did not go through. There was also no publisher announced for TimeSplitters 4 and it was reported that two of the founders, Dave Doak and Steve Ellis, had already left the company earlier that month and established the studio Pumpkin Beach. On 31 December 2008, an administrator announced the studio had not been closed entirely (140 employees had been let go), but that about 40 people had been kept on board to work on a new game concept. It paid off, as on 3 February 2009, Rob Yescombe confirmed the studio had been acquired by Crytek. It was consequently renamed Crytek UK. As a part of Crytek it focused on multiplayer and console development. The first title the UK studio was involved with for Crytek was Crysis 2 (2011). In January 2013, Crytek bought the Homefront IP following publisher THQ's bankruptcy for $500,000. In June 2014, the title Homefront: The Revolution was revealed, in development at Crytek UK, with a tentative release date for 2015. On 30 July 2014, however, it was confirmed Koch Media (via the Deep Silver label) bought the entire Homefront IP from Crytek. At the same time the new Deep Silver Dambuster Studios was established and in accordance with UK law all Crytek UK staff moved along to the new studio, ending the UK Crytek presence. A relaunch of Free Radical Design proper was started by Embracer Group in May 2021 to work on the TimeSplitters series, but was closed by 11 December 2023.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/8f158966-ab6c-11ed-87d1-02420a000197.webp,2000,2013,

Roll7,"Rollingmedia Limited is a UK development studio with Roll7 as its trading name. Most likely it is also part of RDIP Ltd., a company established in 2019. It is owned by Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., which announced the acquisition of the studio on 15th November 2021, as part of its Private Division publishing label. It was founded on 30th April 2008 by John Ribbins (Creative Direction), Simon Andrew James Bennett (Business / Marketing) and Thomas James Hegarty (Production) who have a background in Education, Music and Creative Multimedia – having founded the pioneering youth education company; RollingSound. Between 2008-2013, Roll7 worked as a gun-for-hire studio on original IP and marketing projects for a number of clients, including Channel 4, The Home Office, Lloyds Banks and NeuroSky. During this time, the team also created several prototypes. In 2013, Roll7 pivoted to focus entirely on developing and exploring its own original IP. From a small studio in Deptford in south-east London, the team developed three original titles over three years; OlliOlli, Not a Hero and OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood. With over 75 Awards and Nominations, the OlliOlli series has over 3 million players across 12 platforms and remains Roll7's most successful IP to date. In 2016, Roll7 moved its operations from a physical office into the cloud and developed a distributed production model, scaling up to over 30 people for the multiplayer title – Laser League. ​In 2021, they introduced OlliOlli World; a new direction in the OlliOlli franchise with Take-Two's publishing label Private Division that acquired the studio. In August 2022 Rollerdrome was released. The studio's games strife to offer fast action-based gameplay that is described as 'Flow State Gaming' where mechanics and controls are intuitive and refined, but are meant to grow deep requiring a strong focus until players reach the 'zone'; fully immersed in focus and involvement. This is for instance apparent in the quick tricking and comboing in the OlliOlli games, the popping, sliding and shooting in Not a Hero, or weaving through the hypnotic patterns of Laser League.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/28b87de8-bc7b-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,2014,2022,United Kingdom

"2015, Inc.","2015, Inc. (pronounced twenty-fifteen) is an independent company located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, specializing in first-person, 3D action games for the PC, consoles and handhelds. The company was founded in 1997 by Tom Kudirka. Some of the first titles by 2015 were created by the separate development division Trainwreck Studios (first announced in April 2000), specializing in mid-price to budget games. Under that name Laser Arena (2000) and CIA Operative: Solo Missions (2001) were created. In 2007 it resurfaced with Time Ace for the Nintendo DS. 2015, Inc's first own title was SiN: Wages of Sin (1999), an expansion to Ritual Entertainment's popular shooter SiN (1998). The studio is especially known for pushing Electronic Arts' Medal of Honor series forward with the release of World War II shooter Medal of Honor: Allied Assault in 2002, the first game in the series to appear on the Windows platform. Following the release, EA decided to move development on expansions for the title to its internal Electronic Arts Los Angeles team. A large part of the upper echelons of the company left to form Infinity Ward, a studio that would become known for the rival Call of Duty series based around the same concept. The studio, no longer involved with either of the two franchises, started work on an entirely new game: a shooter set during the Vietnam era. That game became Men of Valor and it was released in 2004  In September 2008 the company announced to have opened the development branch Tornado Studios, focused on casual games. At the same time, 2015, Inc. confirmed that it was still focused on developing action games.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/375d25ee-ab6c-11ed-9505-02420a00019c.webp,1999,2004,United States

Bedtime Digital Games ApS,"Bedtime Digital Games is an independent game development studio based in Aalborg, Denmark. It started as a student production for the 2011 browser game Back to Bed up to Christmas in 2011. It attracted the attention of local and international press and the team decided to develop it further into an expanded game, fixing the bugs, adding more levels and bringing it to more platforms. Most of the work was done in the weekends as many team members had either no or limited time for development due to their jobs. The game did well in several game shows and conferences and received a good deal of nominations and wins. One of these conferences became the turning point for the title. It was among the student showcase winners at IGF 2013 in San Francisco, and even though it did not take home the grand prize it received a lot of attention, notably by CAP NOVA, a Danish investment firm with experience with games. Two team members, Klaus Pedersen and Jonas Byrresen, saw this as a chance do a complete professional release and perhaps something more in the long run. A smaller team was created during the latter half of 2013, and on 16th December 2013 the company Bedtime Digital Games was born. Finishing the game became a long trek and it also took a crowdfunding initiative for the 2014 release of Back to Bed. In the same year the team released the time travel puzzle platformer Chronology. Since then the team has released the musical action games Figment (2017) and Figment 2: Creed Valley (2023) as well as the puzzle adventure The Forest Quartet in 2022.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/d2c5a578-bc7f-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,2014,2023,Denmark

Cyclone Studios,"Helmut Kobler and Ron Little founded Cyclone Studios in December 1993.  With the help from an angel investor's capital and monies out of their own pocket, Cyclone Studios produced a prototype of what would become Captain Quazar.  That prototype helped them secure a contract with 3DO to make Quazar for 3DO’s home console system.  Quazar was a top down isometric 3D cartoon-ish style shooter.  The contract allowed Cyclone to move from Ron Little’s apartment in Oakland to their first small office in Redwood City, California in June 1994. A second title was started called BattleSport that was also for the 3DO system.  BattleSport was a first person 3D tank/soccer type game similar to Ball Blazer.  Soon after in the spring of 1995, Cyclone moved into a still larger office in Menlo Park, California.  Quazar shipped in early 1996 and BattleSport in late 1995.  Both were met with moderate to solid critical acclaim but sold poorly. Poor sales of their first two titles put Cyclone in a dire financial situation at the end of 1995.  Little and Kobler were forced to sell the studio to the 3DO Company in the December 1995.  Cyclone Studios remained as a separate development house but was entirely funded by 3DO.  Kobler was given leadership of the new division and Little was given the roll of tech lead. In the summer of 1996, Cyclone moved to its final location in San Mateo, California.  Two original PC titles were born during this period.  Those two games were Requiem: Avenging Angel and Uprising.  Requiem was a story driven first person shooter.  Uprising was a hybrid first person action/strategy game.  Uprising shipped in October 1997 and Requiem in the April 1999.  Again, both were met with modest to solid critical acclaim but sold below expectations.  Two sequels were made that were inspired by Uprising’s critical success.  Uprising 2: Lead and Destroy for the PC and Uprising X for the Sony Playstation were the last games to be completed by Cyclone in their San Mateo office.   The company’s culture could be best described by a quote from Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street, “Give me guys that are poor, smart and hungry.”  This seemed to be the hiring mantra for Cyclone.  For most of Cyclone’s history, nearly all the artists and programmers had little or no professional game development experience when hired.  Many of the employees were straight out of college.  Virtually all hires had one common trait.  All were avid lifetime gamers.  This mixture paid off in passionate and sometimes volatile results.  Despite the teams’ inexperience (or due to it) all the games made at Cyclone were built from the ground up.  Every game had it’s own unique code and art database.  Everything that went into the game was tailored to the game’s requirements.  This allowed for ideas to be more freely considered and added to the design by anyone involved with the game.  This also contributed to the enthusiasm and volatility at the company.   In the end, some employees would say it was the best job they ever had and others would say the worst.  However, all would agree it was never boring.  In December 1998, Cyclone Studios and its employees were absorbed into 3DO and closed its doors for good.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/8d6fc906-bc78-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1995,1999,United States

Darkworks S.A.,"Darkworks S.A. was an independent game development studio based in Paris, France. It was founded on 8th January 1998 by Antoine Villette (President) and Guillaume Gouraud (General Manager and Artistic Director) as Darkworks Interactive. They both worked at Verity Interactive SARL, the French subsidiary of the American company Verity, Inc., and acquired it to establish it as their own studio. The name was later changed to Darkworks S.A. During its existence the team created and completed two games: Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare (2001) and Cold Fear (2005) as full Darkworks titles. The team was also involved with other projects such as creating Les Visiteurs: Le Jeu (1998) together with Cryo Interactive Entertainment. Many sources claim the company worked on the PS2 / Xbox version of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (2006), but the credits only reveal that a number of Darkworks developers contributed to the level design of the Xbox 360 version, but without explicit mention of the company. Other titles the company was involved with are 1906: An Antarctic Odyssey (1998 - PS2 - sales demo) and USS Antarctica (Xbox - cancelled). Together with TriOviz the company created TriOviz for Games Technology, a technological solution that enables smooth stereoscopic 3D conversion of video games or multimedia products (Windows, Xbox 360, PS3). It was used in such games as Batman: Arkham Asylum (Game of the Year Edition), Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, Thor: God of Thunder, Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters, Captain America: Super Soldier, Gears of War 3, and Batman: Arkham City. The team then worked on a third title, I Am Alive, but in March 2009 it was announced Ubisoft had taken it out of their hands after three years in mutual agreement to have Shanghai UBI Computer Software Co., Ltd. finish it. It was eventually released as a Ubisoft game in March 2012. In September 2011 it was announced the studio would be closed. Another game called Black Death (Windows, Xbox 360, PS3) was still in development, but cancelled. TriOviz acquired all stereoscopic 3D technology and rights.",https://cdn.mobygames.com/f5080f3c-bc79-11ed-bde2-02420a000179.webp,1998,2012,France

Before its closure the studio had been working on Warhammer 40,000: Dark Millennium. Originally revealed in 2007, it was confirmed afterwards that development had been halted in March 2012. In a goodbye message on the website NeoGAF lead combat designer Ben Cureton revealed that the studio had been working on a project codenamed Crawler. Following the closure, Atsushi Inaba, producer at Platinum Games, expressed an interest in acquiring the Darksiders franchise. On 28th January 2013 Crytek GmbH announced to open the new studio Crytek USA Corp., headed by Vigil co-founder David Adams and 35 Vigil developers, making it the spiritual continuation of Vigil, but without taking along the Darksiders franchise.

Active Enterprises Ltd.,"Active Enterprises Ltd. was likely formed in 1989, the year in which, according to their company information from 1993, the idea for Action 52 was formed. The company, formed by Vince Perri and Raul Gomila was based out of Florida with a headquarters in the Bahamas. In 1991 Active released their initial videogame title ""Action 52"" to the market. General information would tell us that based on its rarity it must not have sold well, but no sales figures exist. In early 1992, Active trademarked several of its creations such as, Cheetahmen, and Action 52. By 1993, Active had contracted California based company Farsight Technologies (now FarSight Studios) to create Action 52 for the Sega Genesis and SNES as well as Sports 5.  In 1993 Active published their first and only Sega Genesis cartridge, Action 52. It took advantage of the sixteen bit power of the Genesis to provide a significant graphics and sound upgrade to the 1991 NES original. The release of Action 52 for the Super Nintendo likely would have provided a superior game to the Genesis version but it wasn't released, nor was the Action Gamemaster or either version of Sports 5.  By the time 1994 rolled around Active had apparently left the video game market. What happened to Active Enterprises after this is really anyone's guess. What we do know is that they merged with Ivan Koulakovski's company ""Voice Technologies"" and that Vince Perri left the company a short time afterward.

The story unfolds around a group of characters who become infected by a parasitic tadpole, threatening to turn them into Mind Flayers, a dreaded and alien species known for their psionic abilities and power over other creatures.

Additionally, decision-making and character interactions play significant roles, with player choices leading to varying narrative outcomes, affecting not only the story's progression but also relationships with party members and other NPCs.A notable feature is its adherence to many Dungeons & Dragons mechanics, translating the tabletop experience into a digital format. Dice-rolling, a staple of the D&D system, is integral to many actions and decisions in the game, introducing elements of chance and unpredictability.

The passage of time is central to gameplay, using a calendar system that divides each day into segments. Players must carefully manage how they spend their time—balancing dungeon exploration, social activities, and story progression. Unlike earlier Atlus titles, Metaphor reduces downtime and filler, resulting in a more focused pacing aligned with the urgency of the game's events.A refined version of the Persona series’ social systems appears in the form of Bond and Royal Virtue mechanics. These track relationships and personal growth with greater transparency, allowing players to make informed choices about how and when to level up specific attributes. These systems reinforce the central theme of building trust and unity, as players connect with a diverse cast of characters across various regions and social backgrounds.Combat is turn-based and deeply strategic, drawing on the press-turn system known from Shin Megami Tensei. Players and enemies gain additional actions by exploiting elemental weaknesses, rewarding careful planning and adaptability. The game's standout feature is the Archetype system—a flexible job system where characters can adopt various roles and retain skills across multiple classes. Archetypes can be mixed within the party to unlock powerful Synthesis attacks, which consume multiple turn icons to execute high-impact moves or special support abilities. This system encourages experimentation and thoughtful party composition.To complement its turn-based structure, Metaphor also includes real-time elements. Players can engage weaker enemies with action-based attacks to bypass traditional battles, making exploration more efficient. Combat-related progression is supported by generous item distribution, enabling players to level up Archetypes even outside of battle. This reduces grinding and promotes consistent development throughout the game.The game features a dynamic world map, traversed using the Gauntlet Runner—a mobile, steampunk-inspired hub that functions as both a travel method and a place to train characters, develop bonds, and prepare for the next phase of the journey.

While exploration is limited compared to open-world RPGs, the design focuses on visual detail and narrative atmosphere. The environments range from sunlit forests and submerged cities to abstract and surreal locations such as gothic ship graveyards and forgotten battlefields.Narratively, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 delves into themes of death, legacy, and the cyclical nature of trauma.

They are later joined by Verso, a former member of Expedition 00, and his companions Monoco and Esquie. Over time, the party uncovers deeper truths about the Paintress, the origin of the Gommage, and their own identities.Visually, the game is notable for its painterly art direction, expressive character models, and melancholic tone. It represents a stylistic and mechanical fusion of influences from classic JRPGs such as Final Fantasy and Persona, action-RPG elements akin to Dark Souls, and rhythm-based gameplay."

Balatro,https://cdn.mobygames.com/cced7cdc-9c9f-11ef-b05f-02420a000147.webp,"Balatro is a strategic card game with a roguelike structure influenced by the Cantonese card game Big Two and Luck be a Landlord. A game is played as a run that is different every time because of various parameters and random elements. It is up to the player to organize and enhance a standard deck of 52 cards to complete the run, which ends the game. During runs various elements are unlocked permanently, but as is typical for a roguelike, most of the items and progress are lost as soon as the run is over, whether it was completed successfully or not. A run is divided into multiple steps called Blinds with a limited number of hands. If a Blind cannot be completed because the requirements are not met, the game is over right away.Scoring in the game is based around the standard hands of the Poker such as a high card, a pair, a flush or a full house. There are however a lot of game elements that add to the strategy. There is a cash system where money between Blinds can be spent on new cards and card modifications. For instance, both individual cards and hands can be upgraded, making a pair earn more than a straight. The standard deck can contain enhanced cards of various types, but players can also destroy cards, removing them permanently, or introduce new cards. That way, it is for instance possible to get rid of some Jacks and replace them with additional aces instead. Unlike as is common in most deck building games, it is possible to run out of cards in a single Blind when all of them have been dealt.Other game elements are Joker cards that provide bonuses and multipliers and single-use tarot cards that can be used at specific moments for a strategic advantage. In the third and final Blind of a round the player is often challenged to work around certain restrictions, such as hidden cards, debuffed cards or only allowing a specific hand to be played.The roguelike structure is further deepened by unlocking specific starting decks and multiple difficulties. Many game elements are also only unlocked over time, as more Joker cards are added to the starting pool."

Each morning begins in the estate’s central lobby, where players are presented with three sealed doors. Choosing one leads to a draft of three potential rooms, and only one of these can be placed. This room becomes part of the current day’s mansion layout. As the player continues, they add more rooms in this fashion, making strategic decisions about which spaces to include based on available doors, room features, and ongoing goals. Once the day ends—either by exhausting resources or reaching a stopping point—the mansion resets. The player begins the next day anew in the lobby, but with only certain permanent upgrades retained, such as blueprint enhancements or unlocked room types.A core mechanic of the game is the management of footsteps, which represent how far the player can travel during a single day. Each transition from one room to another consumes a footstep, and backtracking consumes additional steps, creating a push-pull between exploration and efficiency. When footsteps run out, the day ends. Another central mechanic involves the use of doors as strategic gateways. Rooms can contain one or more doors, and the player must consider how each room connects to the broader layout. Poor planning can result in cul-de-sacs or dead ends, limiting further expansion and progress toward the ultimate goal.The mansion is also filled with various items and resources that support exploration. Coins, which may be found in decorative environments such as bars or living rooms, can be used in special vendor rooms to purchase helpful tools. Gems allow access to rare and valuable room choices during the drafting phase. Keys serve multiple functions, from opening locked doors to unlocking specific types of rooms or pathways. The interaction between these items and the environment adds complexity and variety to each run. Players may encounter rooms with safes, locked cabinets, or darkened spaces that require light from elsewhere in the house, creating environmental puzzles that often span multiple rooms or runs.While the search for the final room is presented as the main goal, various clues and mechanics become apparent to attentive players, with layers upon layers of puzzles and lore, both inside and outside the house."

Players resume control of Jin Sakai, a samurai defending Tsushima Island from occupying Mongol forces, now facing new challenges that test his code of honor, adaptability, and leadership.The player navigates a large open world, using horseback travel, grappling hooks for vertical traversal, and the iconic Guiding Wind mechanic to traverse dense forests, temples, and mountain paths. Combat emphasizes skillful timing and stance switching, such as Stone, Water, Wind, and Moon stances - each effective against specific enemy types. Activating Ghost Stance provides temporary invincibility and one-hit kills after filling the resolve meter.

The game continues the story of Razputin “Raz” Aquato, a young psychic who has finally joined the international espionage organization known as the Psychonauts. Shortly after his initiation, Raz becomes involved in an investigation to uncover a mole within headquarters and prevent the resurrection of Maligula, a powerful psychic from the organization’s past.The player controls Raz in a story-driven adventure that moves between real-world hub areas and the inner landscapes of various characters’ minds. Each mental world serves as a unique level, designed around the fears, memories, and personalities of its host. Progress through these surreal environments reveals new details about the conspiracy facing the Psychonauts and the struggles of the individuals Raz is trying to help. Outside the minds, players explore the Motherlobe headquarters and surrounding areas, interacting with fellow interns and agents while discovering side quests and secrets.Gameplay combines platforming, combat, and puzzle-solving. Raz performs acrobatic maneuvers such as double jumps, dashes, rope swings, and rail grinds, while also wielding psychic abilities. Returning powers include telekinesis, clairvoyance, pyrokinesis, and levitation, while new abilities such as Mental Connection allow Raz to grapple thought bubbles and alter a character’s associations. Enemies are manifestations of negative emotions, like Censors, Regrets, and Bad Ideas, each with different attack patterns. Combat blends melee strikes with psychic powers, which can be assigned to controller buttons for quick use.Progression is tied to collecting figments, emotional baggage, half-a-minds, and memory vaults hidden in each level. These contribute to raising Raz’s PSI rank, which grants intern credits for upgrading abilities. Collectible PSI cards and challenge markers further increase rank, while in-game currency can be spent on items or on “pins,” modifiers that alter Raz’s abilities or add cosmetic flourishes. Health is measured by brains, and PSI energy powers psychic attacks, both replenished through pickups scattered across levels.Between story missions, players can explore hub areas, interact with NPCs, and complete optional platforming challenges. Side quests provide rewards such as items or resources and expand background details about characters and locations. Exploration also reveals hidden collectibles and minigames. Although the story follows a fixed structure without branching paths, dialogue and character interactions provide humor and context for Raz’s journey.The levels emphasize thematic variety, each representing the host’s unique state of mind. One features a dentist’s nightmare filled with oversized teeth, while another combines a hospital and a casino to reflect compulsive behavior. Boss battles serve as climactic encounters, requiring the use of Raz’s psychic abilities and environmental features to succeed. Some stages temporarily shift mechanics, introducing rhythm sequences or alternate perspectives to keep gameplay varied.Psychonauts 2 runs in third-person perspective with automatic saving across all versions. Completed levels can be revisited once new powers are unlocked, allowing players to collect missed items. The title supports full controller mapping and accessibility settings, and although the story is linear, the design encourages thorough exploration and mastery of Raz’s abilities."

It continues the long-running Mishima family saga, focusing on the battle between Kazuya Mishima and his son, Jin Kazama, as the conflict threatens the world. Jin must confront his father’s destructive ambitions while struggling against the Devil Gene within himself. The story mode follows this central conflict through cinematic cutscenes and staged fights, blending narrative and gameplay to advance the plot.The core gameplay remains rooted in one-on-one matches fought in 3D arenas. Players choose from a roster of returning fighters and newcomers, each with unique fighting styles, movesets, and signature abilities. Combat revolves around high, mid, and low attacks, throws, and counters, with victory earned by depleting an opponent’s health bar in two out of three rounds. Movement allows sidesteps and positioning adjustments in 3D space, which adds a layer of tactical depth compared to purely 2D fighters.Tekken 8 introduces the Heat System as its main innovation. Each fighter has access to Heat Burst and Heat Engager attacks that activate a temporary empowered state. While Heat is active, characters gain enhanced properties such as chip damage, new attack options, and altered move animations. Heat can be triggered once per round and must be used strategically, either for immediate offensive pressure or to extend combos. Alongside Heat, mechanics like Rage Arts return, providing cinematic finishing moves when a character’s health is critically low.Progression outside of battle comes through practice modes, tutorials, and character customization. Players can earn fight money to purchase cosmetic items that alter costumes, accessories, and effects without changing gameplay balance. The story mode provides a structured narrative campaign centered on Jin and Kazuya, while side episodes explore other characters’ motivations and rivalries. Arcade Quest serves as an additional mode where players create a customizable avatar and compete across virtual arcades, simulating a progression through Tekken’s competitive history.Online functionality is a major component of the game. Ranked and player matches allow competition worldwide, supported by rollback netcode to ensure smoother connections. Tekken Fight Lounge serves as a multiplayer hub where avatars can interact, train together, and enter matchmaking. Cross-platform play allows users on different systems to fight each other, broadening the player base.Tekken 8 also emphasizes accessibility and secondary systems. A Special Style control scheme simplifies complex commands into single button inputs for casual play, while retaining the traditional scheme for advanced players. Training tools include frame data displays, move lists, and practice features that assist players in learning character strategies. A replay system enables users to watch past matches with data overlays and even take control during playback to practice counters."

When Alyx discovers the existence of a vault that supposedly contains a superweapon, she sets out to claim it for the Resistance, setting in motion a chain of events that will have drastic consequences on her future.The game features the classic hallmarks of the Half-Life series: exploration and puzzle-solving within a linear narrative. Unlike Gordon Freeman, Alyx is a voiced protagonist and will comment on her surroundings as well as have audible dialogue with other characters. Her Gravity Gloves, similar to Half-Life 2's Gravity Gun, are used to grab objects from afar and pull them towards the player. Alyx collects weapons throughout the game which can be upgraded at specific Combine upgrade stations; each upgrade costs a different amount of Resin, a resource that can be found throughout most of the game's environments."
It Takes Two,https://cdn.mobygames.com/afd10f02-ac0e-11ed-8ce3-02420a000131.webp,"It Takes Two is a cooperative-only action platform game. It requires two players at all times, either via local split-screen or online play. A single player cannot complete the game, as each section is designed around both characters contributing simultaneously. The game supports “Friend’s Pass,” allowing one player to invite another online even if they do not own a copy.Cody and May are a married couple on the verge of divorce, whose daughter Rose wishes to keep them together. After making dolls of her parents out of wood and clay, Rose’s tears magically transform them into the toys. The couple awakens in miniature form inside their own home, guided by the eccentric talking Book of Love, authored by Dr. Hakim. To return to their human bodies, Cody and May must work together, overcoming surreal environments that reflect the challenges in their relationship. The story is told through stages that metaphorically explore themes of family, trust, and reconciliation.Gameplay blends multiple genres across its levels. Platforming is the core mechanic, with characters running, jumping, and dashing across elaborate environments. Each level introduces new mechanics, such as rail grinding, shooting sections, puzzle-solving, or environmental manipulation. Boss fights punctuate chapters, requiring both players to use their current abilities in tandem. Minigames are scattered throughout, offering competitive diversions ranging from simple races to rhythm challenges. The dynamic split-screen presentation shifts fluidly to emphasize critical actions, and it remains present even during online co-op. Throughout the campaign, Cody and May gain unique abilities that vary with each chapter, ensuring asymmetrical cooperation - such as one character manipulating time while the other creates clones, or one controlling magnets of opposing polarities.Progression is chapter-based rather than open-ended. Players advance linearly through themed areas representing elements of Cody and May’s lives, such as their garden, attic, and a child’s toy castle. Levels mix environmental hazards with puzzles that can only be solved through communication and coordination. Failure results in quick respawns, keeping the pace consistent and minimizing downtime. There are no collectibles that significantly alter gameplay; instead, exploration rewards players with hidden minigames or playful interactions in the environment.The title does not employ traditional role-playing systems such as character leveling or permanent upgrades. Abilities are reset at the start of each chapter, ensuring that mechanics are tailored to the narrative setting rather than long-term progression. This design choice prevents players from relying on a single set of skills and emphasizes variety across the game’s duration. Each level’s mechanics are supported by highly detailed environments that turn mundane household objects into large-scale playgrounds.Dialogues and cutscenes advance the story between gameplay sections, often featuring arguments between Cody and May or comedic appearances from Dr. Hakim. Player choices do not affect the outcome of the story, as the narrative unfolds in a fixed structure. However, interactive dialogue moments and character banter during gameplay add variety and humor to the journey."

Players can switch between party members - including Cloud, Tifa, Barret, and Aerith - and execute special commands, spells, or items once the ATB gauge fills. The classic materia system returns, enabling players to equip magic, summons, support, and stat-boosting orbs into weapons and armor. Combat is enriched with dodge, parry, and environmental interaction mechanics.The remake includes seamless transitions between exploration and cinematic sequences powered by Unreal Engine 4, bringing Midgar to life with high-fidelity character models, fluid animations, and reactive environments.

Mounts are introduced as a core travel mechanic, allowing hunters to quickly move across regions, perform mounted attacks, and switch equipment while on the move. Monsters roam freely and behave according to their own routines, with some becoming territorial during certain weather conditions or hunting other species in large-scale encounters.Combat remains centered on real-time melee and ranged weapon classes, including great swords, bows, lances, and dual blades, each with unique combos, charge mechanics, and defensive techniques. Hunters manage stamina for dodging and blocking, sharpen melee weapons during hunts, and use specialized items such as traps, bombs, and healing potions. The new Focus Mode provides lock-on targeting and greater precision in striking monster weak points, while elemental effects and weapon affinities further influence damage output. Dynamic weather events such as sandstorms and thunderstorms alter monster behavior and visibility, forcing players to adapt mid-mission.Progression involves tracking monsters, collecting materials, and returning resources to craft new weapons, armor sets, and upgrades. Armor skills grant passive bonuses, with set bonuses offering specialized builds tailored to specific weapon playstyles. Gathering plants, ores, and monster parts contributes to a resource loop that fuels both personal gear and settlement improvements. Completing hunts grants Hunter Rank and Master Rank progress, which unlock higher-tier challenges and stronger monsters.Multiplayer remains integral, with up to four hunters able to join hunts cooperatively, either by matchmaking or responding to SOS flares. Teamwork is emphasized through stagger mechanics, coordinated traps, and resource sharing.

Characters auto-attack when in range, while players activate Arts mapped to buttons, each with unique effects, cooldowns, and positional bonuses. The system emphasizes party coordination, with multiple roles: attackers, defenders, and healers.Progression is linked to the flexible class system. Each of the six main characters can adopt different classes, such as Swordfighter, Medic Gunner, or Zephyr, and earn new skills, Arts, and equipment options. Unlocking additional hero characters through quests expands the class selection further. Equipping different combinations of Arts, skills, and accessories lets players customize builds for each encounter.A unique mechanic is the Ouroboros system, where paired characters can fuse into a more powerful form with its own moveset and abilities.

Ellie is immune to the infection that has destroyed civilization, and their journey forces them to confront hostile survivors and infected creatures alike. The narrative explores their relationship as they traverse ruined cities, quarantine zones, and wilderness while searching for a group known as the Fireflies.Gameplay is presented in third person, combining exploration, stealth, and combat. Players control Joel for most of the game, navigating open-ended environments filled with enemies and supplies. Stealth is often required, as ammunition and resources are limited. Players can choke enemies silently, craft makeshift weapons, and take cover behind objects during firefights.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,https://cdn.mobygames.com/4c627f90-54f5-11f0-9162-02420a000184.webp,"Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is an action game and the sequel to Death Stranding. Set eleven months after the events of the first game, the game follows Sam Porter Bridges, now living in seclusion with Lou in Mexico. When Fragile requests his help to expand the Chiral Network across Mexico and Australia, Sam is drawn back into a mission to reconnect humanity in the wake of continued supernatural threats. Australia, ravaged by environmental disasters and otherworldly entities, serves as the game's primary setting. As Sam and his companions journey across the continent, they face escalating threats from both human and non-human forces, questioning the consequences of reconnecting a fractured world.The game retains the third-person, open-world structure of its predecessor. Gameplay centers on traversal, logistics, and environmental navigation, with players managing cargo distribution and movement across rugged terrain. New to the sequel are expanded delivery systems, more complex terrain deformation, and new tools such as deployable shelters, amphibious vehicles, and enhanced exoskeletons. Players must balance load weight, equipment, and pathfinding as they traverse varied biomes affected by Timefall, a rain that rapidly ages organic material.It also introduces a greater emphasis on combat and player choice, allowing for direct confrontations, stealth tactics, or evasion through difficult terrain. Players can utilize an expanded arsenal of weapons, vehicles, and tools, including customizable vehicles, drones, and experimental equipment like the ""blood boomerang"". Natural disasters such as earthquakes, sandstorms, and flash floods dynamically alter the environment, affecting traversal and mission planning.A skill system known as the Automated Porter Assistant System (APAS) lets players enhance Sam’s abilities across combat, stealth, and delivery efficiency. Equipment and perks are unlocked by completing missions and side objectives, offering various approaches to gameplay challenges. The social Strand system returns, allowing asynchronous cooperation with other players by constructing infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and a new monorail system, facilitating faster transportation of goods across the continent. Players also have the ability to customize and command automated delivery bots, participate in cooperative missions through temporal anomalies, and explore indoor environments and vertical settlements. The chiral network has evolved into a multidimensional infrastructure, offering expanded narrative paths and player influence over regional development."
Slay the Princess,https://cdn.mobygames.com/c51a6d10-71b4-11ee-ae9e-02420a000121.webp,"Slay the Princess is a single-player narrative-driven visual novel with branching paths and psychological horror elements. The player assumes the role of a nameless protagonist who awakens in a forest clearing with a single task: to slay a princess imprisoned in a cabin deep within the woods. A disembodied narrator insists that this is the only way to prevent the end of the world. The princess, however, pleads for her life and challenges the truth of the narrator’s words, leaving the player to decide whether to trust their guide or the supposed threat before them. Each choice leads to dramatic consequences, shaping both the protagonist’s fate and the unfolding of the story.Gameplay primarily consists of dialogue-driven interactions and branching decision-making. The player navigates through illustrated story sequences, choosing responses in conversations with the narrator, the princess, and at times, other voices that emerge. Unlike traditional role-playing systems, there are no statistics or inventories. Instead, progression is determined entirely by player choice, with each decision opening or closing narrative paths. Outcomes can range from immediate death to altered storylines that persist into subsequent encounters.The game is structured around repeated loops that recall elements of roguelike progression. After each ending, the protagonist reawakens in the forest with fragmented memories of past encounters. This cycle allows the player to approach the princess in new ways, gradually revealing layers of her nature and the true stakes of the encounter. The narrative expands with each iteration, and prior decisions influence how future versions of the story unfold.A key feature of the gameplay is its unreliable guidance. The narrator offers strong direction but can be questioned, defied, or ignored, and the princess’s words often contradict his. As the player pursues different choices, the protagonist’s personality and relationship to both figures evolve, creating multiple branching story arcs. These branching structures include radically different scenarios, transformations of the protagonist, and metaphysical developments that extend beyond the initial premise.The dialogue system is the emphasis rather than traditional combat. Confrontations with the princess are often resolved through persuasion, resistance, or surrender, with violence serving as one possible outcome among many. There are no action-based mechanics, but player agency is tested through repeated moral decisions, trust, and the acceptance or rejection of uncertainty.The game was later expanded with The Pristine Cut, which added new story routes, artwork, and voice content. This edition broadened the scope of available narrative branches and provided more variation in how repeated loops could evolve, ensuring additional replayability across different platforms."
Hi-Fi Rush,https://cdn.mobygames.com/4a9f935c-ac17-11ed-a7ec-02420a000134.webp,"Hi-Fi Rush is a single-player, action rhythm-based brawler. The game follows Chai, a wannabe rock star who volunteers for a corporate experiment and accidentally ends up with a music player fused to his chest. Branded a defect by the corporation that performed the experiment, Chai becomes a target for extermination and must battle his way through company executives, robotic enforcers, and security systems. Along the way he forms a team of allies, each with their own abilities, who join him in resisting the company’s plans.Gameplay centers on rhythm-driven combat where every attack, dodge, and ability is tied to the beat of the soundtrack. Chai wields a makeshift guitar-shaped weapon to perform light and heavy combos. Players are encouraged to time their actions with the background music, as synchronization enhances damage and builds combo multipliers. Even if input is slightly off, the animations align to the beat, ensuring the rhythm is always maintained. Chai’s companions can be summoned mid-fight to exploit enemy weaknesses or trigger puzzle-solving abilities, such as breaking shields or activating distant switches.Progression is structured around mission-based stages, each with distinct environments, hazards, and themed bosses. Defeating enemies rewards gears, a form of currency used to purchase new moves and abilities. Additional upgrades can increase health, special attack capacity, and combat options. The game grades performance after battles and stages based on timing accuracy, combo variety, and damage taken, encouraging replay to improve ranks.Extra modes unlock after completion, such as higher difficulty levels, time-based challenges, and a rhythm tower that tests endurance against waves of enemies."

The story is set on the continent of Valandis, a land scarred by centuries of war between three kingdoms. As ancient weapons and political conspiracies threaten to plunge the region into further conflict, a group of adventurers from different walks of life is drawn together. Their goal is to uncover the source of the strife, confront the forces manipulating the kingdoms, and seek peace for a world on the edge of collapse.The game uses turn-based combat with a strong emphasis on tactical resource management. Battles are fought by a party of up to four active members, with additional characters able to be swapped in during encounters. Instead of traditional mana pools, the game employs an Overdrive system. This mechanic rewards careful planning, as players must maintain a balance between building momentum to strengthen attacks and avoiding an overheated state that leaves the party vulnerable. Attacks, skills, and defense options must be chosen strategically to keep the gauge within the optimal range.Progression allows each character to unlock and upgrade a wide array of skills. Skill points are earned through battles and quests, and these can be invested to improve attacks, defensive abilities, or support techniques. As characters grow, players can refine their builds by equipping crystals that enhance or modify weapons and armor. Crystals can be combined or slotted into gear to create powerful effects, offering a layer of customization beyond simple equipment upgrades.Exploration plays a key role, with players traveling across varied environments such as forests, ruins, towns, and mountains. The world map connects these areas into a cohesive setting filled with hidden treasures, side quests, and optional bosses. Mechs known as Sky Armors become available later, allowing both flight-based traversal and expanded combat options. These suits provide distinct abilities compared to standard ground battles and open access to previously unreachable areas."

Mario and one partner character enter combat, where they can attack, use special moves, or employ items. Players can press buttons with precise timing to enhance attacks or reduce incoming damage. Star Power abilities provide powerful skills once the player has collected Crystal Stars, adding another layer of strategy to combat encounters. The audience system introduces spectators who react to the flow of combat, cheering when Mario performs well and occasionally tossing items that can aid or hinder him. Stylish moves, performed by pressing buttons at key moments, boost audience engagement and restore Star Power more quickly.Progression is tied to exploration of distinct chapters, each with its own themed location, story events, and bosses. As Mario defeats enemies, he gains experience points that increase his level. Upon leveling up, players can choose to increase Mario’s health, Flower Points for special moves, or Badge Points, which determine how many ability-granting badges he can equip. Badges provide varied effects, from altering attacks to granting new techniques.Outside combat, the game emphasizes puzzle-solving and environmental interaction. Mario can transform into paper forms, such as folding into a plane to glide or turning sideways to slip through cracks. These abilities expand as the story progresses and are essential for advancing through dungeons and hidden paths.This version retains the full content of the original release while incorporating updated visuals, remastered music, and quality-of-life improvements. The structure of the chapters, combat, and progression systems remain faithful to the core design, presenting the same blend of RPG battles, exploration, and puzzle-solving."

The story follows Dave, an easygoing diver who becomes involved in an unusual business venture at a mysterious location known as the Blue Hole. By day, Dave explores its shifting underwater ecosystem, searching for fish, artifacts, and resources. By night, he helps run a sushi restaurant that depends on his daily catches, tying his role as diver and provider together into one ongoing routine.Gameplay alternates between two main activities: underwater exploration and restaurant management. During the day, players guide Dave through procedurally changing underwater zones filled with varied marine life and hazards. Oxygen serves as the primary limit on how long each dive lasts, with air tanks functioning as both life support and a health system. Weapons such as harpoons and firearms are used to hunt fish, while careful resource management is required to gather materials and still return safely to the surface.Combat against aggressive sea creatures and bosses emphasizes timing and positioning. Weapons and gear can be upgraded by investing resources found during dives, including crafting parts that enhance performance. Oxygen depletion or sustaining too much damage ends a dive, with only part of the collected loot retained. Exploration is further shaped by environmental hazards such as strong currents, deep-sea predators, and limited visibility.At night, the focus shifts to running a sushi restaurant. The fish Dave catches are prepared and served to customers, with menu planning and inventory management directly affecting profits. Players must balance hiring and training staff, upgrading facilities, and efficiently serving customers during timed sequences. Restaurant operations provide the funds necessary to expand diving gear, creating a loop between underwater risk-taking and nightly business management. Restaurant management gradually scales up, with new recipes, ingredients, and upgrades unlocking as the business grows. Balancing staff skills, customer demand, and available resources becomes increasingly complex as the game progresses.

The game is framed as a rediscovered catalog of fifty titles reportedly produced by a fictional 1980s company called UFO Soft. Presented with authentic 8-bit visuals, chiptune music, and simulated boot-up screens, each game appears as its own standalone cartridge complete with a title screen, manual-style lore, and a unique aesthetic. Players can explore each game immediately from the start, shifting between fast arcade-like experiences and deeper genre experiments.The 50-included titles span a wide range of genres, including platformers, shooters, puzzles, RPG-style adventures, sports, stealth, and strategy. Each game operates within its own ruleset, encouraging players to adapt rapidly. Mechanically, games differ significantly: some focus on high-score runs; others offer character progression, exploration, or strategic depth. About half support local multiplayer in versus or cooperative modes. A metagame encourages completion by unlocking deeper narratives and references across games. Modern conveniences include save points, difficulty modifiers through relics, and seamless switching between titles.Included Titles:1. Barbuta	is a single-player action platform game. In this medieval-themed metroidvania-like title, players control a slow-moving knight who explores a labyrinthine dungeon filled with traps, enemies, and dead ends. Death is easy in this world - one misstep against a mushroom or bat sends the knight back to the start. The game emphasizes deliberate exploration and incremental mastery of the interconnected map. Mechanically, Barbuta offers tight platforming and simple combat with a sword. The absence of falling damage shifts focus to hazard navigation and environmental puzzle solving. The player's progress is often measured in small gains toward mapping and safely navigating the dungeon.2. Bug Hunter	is a single-player puzzle strategy game. Set on a grid-based battlefield, players assume the role of a bug exterminator tasked with clearing insect infestations before they spread. Strategy lies in choosing optimal movement and attacks while managing a deadline - if eggs hatch, the mission is lost. The game blends turn-based tactics with modular deck-building mechanics. Players collect ""modules"" (action options) to customize their approach to each level. Balancing offense, defense, and time constraints forms the core challenge.3. Ninpek	is a single-player arcade platform game. In this swift auto-scrolling ninja platformer, players guide a nimble shinobi through a series of perilous levels. While running automatically, the ninja must leap over hazards and dispatch foes with precision timing. Gameplay emphasizes rhythmic movement and rapid reactions, echoing side-scrolling classics like SonSon. Despite its unrelenting pace, levels remain short, requiring minimal time investment per run but rewarding repeat attempts. Ninpek’s challenge comes from memorizing patterns and coordinating jumps under pressure.4. Paint Chase	is a single-player arcade maze game. This title invites players to control a car around a maze, aiming to paint more floor space than AI-controlled competitors - an amalgam of Pac-Man and Splatoon.

Magic Garden	is a single-player puzzle arcade game. This title blends snake-like mechanics with collectible growth. The player maneuvers a creature through a garden, gathering items while avoiding self-collision and environment hazards. As items are collected, the creature grows, constraining movement and requiring route planning to avoid becoming trapped.6. Mortol	is a single-player puzzle platform game. Set in the kingdom of Mortolia, players control citizens tasked with reclaiming their land through ritual powers. Each character can perform Rituals of Arrow (creating a platform), Bomb (explosion), or Stone (barrier), often sacrificing themselves instead of surviving. These mechanics allow traversal and puzzle-solving within interconnected levels. Death is a tool rather than a failure, embedded in the progression structure. Lives are limited, making strategic use of sacrifices essential. Levels include checkpoints, and extra lives are awarded for collecting items or defeating enemies.7. Velgress	is a single-player vertical platform endurance game. Players guide Alpha, a captured space pirate, as she climbs out of a pit filled with disappearing platforms and hazards. The vertical levels auto-degrade beneath her feet, pressing players to ascend rapidly while maintaining precision. Floors are numbered, and the game tracks how high the player has reached, encouraging personal best improvements. Contact with a lethal roller at the bottom ends the run. The climb includes coins for collection, used between attempts to purchase upgrades like magnetized pickups or slower platform decay. Hidden challenges and a secret fourth level become accessible through careful play.8. Planet Zoldath	is a single-player diagonal-down adventure game. Players control an explorer named Pilot, navigating a hostile planet in search of three treasure map pieces to escape. The world includes both friendly and aggressive NPCs. Friendly NPCs can be communicated with using the Translator item to trade for map pieces or other resources, while aggressive NPCs may explode or attack with predictable patterns. Key items - such as the boomerang, nail gun, metamorpher, hazard boots, pulse generator, bombs, and a meat printer - enable traversal, puzzle-solving, and survival. Many mechanics are intentionally opaque, encouraging learning through experimentation. Exploration, item usage, and environmental interaction are central to completing objectives and progressing.9. Attactics	is a single-player grid-based strategy game. This auto-battler unfolds on a grid where players deploy troops on the left side, which march rightward to confront incoming enemies. Strategy lies in unit placement - moving up, down, or backward on the grid - to form effective formations and counter enemy waves. Matches are automatic once units are placed, requiring tactical foresight rather than real-time input. Players must adapt to continuously evolving threats as enemies adjust composition.10. Devilition	is a single-player puzzle strategy game. The game challenges players to arrange demons on a grid so that their placement triggers chain reactions of explosions. Each demon type likely exhibits distinct patterns or effects, making placement tactical. While details on specific mechanics are sparse, the core loop relies on spatial reasoning, planning chain sequences, and managing limited space.11. Kick Club	is a single-player arcade platform game. This single-screen action-platformer blends sports and combat as players kick a soccer ball to defeat enemies scattered across each layout. The ball can bounce off enemies to cause damage or dispatch multiple foes in a chain for higher scores. Letting the ball stay still breaks combos, while timing and positioning matter. Chain reactions reward better item drops, and some stages wrap vertically, forgiving mistakes.12. Avianos	is a single-player strategy game. Players command wings of dinosaur units vying for territory control on a hex grid. Units spawn at the left and march right toward opponent columns. Strategic placement (up, down, or backward) dictates pathing and confrontation. Early in play, mechanics were turn-based, but were replaced with auto-combat to heighten pacing. Resource management and positioning matter as players aim to claim more zones than the computer-controlled adversary.13. Mooncat	is a single-player platform game. In this surreal platformer, players guide a cat across moon landscapes using unconventional controls: the D-pad moves left, face buttons move right, opposite direction makes the cat drop downward, and pressing buttons midair executes a dive bomb. Level themes shift from moon forests to caves, underwater scenes, and fortified areas, each introducing varied hazards and platforming logic. The control layout subverts standard habits, requiring players to consciously adapt to its mechanics.14. Bushido Ball	is a single-player and local multiplayer sports game. This samurai-themed Pong variant involves volleying a ball using sword slices and body blocks. Players choose from several characters, each equipped with unique special moves unlocked through successful volleys. As rallies progress, a special gauge fills, granting access to powerful techniques that can turn the tide. The match escalates in speed over time, demanding quick reflexes and strategic shot placement.15. Block Koala	is a single-player puzzle game, reminiscent of Sokoban. This block-matching titles presents players with a grid where they must clear and arrange blocks to solve increasingly complex puzzles.

The grid-based logic emphasizes pattern recognition and forward planning, as shapes must be cleared without backing into traps or dead-end layouts.16. Camouflage	is a single-player puzzle and stealth game. Players navigate tile-based levels where the goal is to blend into the environment by switching patterns or colors to match the terrain. Movement must be carefully timed to avoid detection from roaming enemies, whose patrol paths grow increasingly complex. Certain levels demand the player to stay still at the right moment, while others involve switching camouflage on the fly. Each stage is presented as a logic puzzle, with a limited number of moves or disguises available, encouraging efficient problem-solving. Camouflage combines visual pattern recognition with stealth planning.17. Campanella	is a single-player arcade action game focused on exploration. The game unfolds in a dreamlike setting where progress is tied to sound and resonance.

Exploration encourages experimentation, as tonal interactions transform platforms or awaken characters who provide guidance. Progression occurs gradually through discovery, with each new area.18. Golfaria	is a single-player action-platform game with puzzle elements. Set in cavernous, interconnected levels, players advance by striking a golf ball through obstacles, switches, and enemies. The ball acts as both a weapon and a traversal tool, knocking open hidden passages or activating platforms when directed correctly. Movement combines standard platforming with careful lining up of shots, giving the experience a hybrid feel between a Metroidvania and a physics-based golf puzzler. Progression unlocks new areas and challenges, rewarding accuracy and timing as much as exploration. Golfaria’s novelty lies in its fusion of sports mechanics with dungeon-like progression.19. The Big Bell Race	is a single-player time-based platform game. Players must reach a large bell at the end of each stage before the clock expires. Levels are built around quick reflexes, requiring players to optimize routes, chain jumps, and exploit shortcuts. Hazards, such as disappearing floors or moving obstacles, challenge timing and consistency. Bonus rewards are granted for faster completion.20. Warp Tank	is a single-player vehicular action and puzzle game. Players control a tank equipped with short-range warp technology, allowing it to teleport across obstacles or reposition quickly in combat. Levels mix shooting engagements with environmental puzzles, such as warping past barriers, evading traps, or ambushing enemy turrets. Limited warp energy requires careful management, with pickups or cooldowns dictating use. Combat remains straightforward, but puzzles demand creative application of movement and timing.21. Waldorf’s Journey	is a single-player narrative-driven platform game. Players guide Waldorf through side-scrolling environments that emphasize storytelling as much as platforming. Each stage is built around interactions with characters who present dialogue, choices, or tasks that expand the overarching narrative. Platforming challenges are generally accessible, serving as transitions between story events rather than obstacles on their own. Collectibles tied to memories or objects provide background details.22. Porgy	is a single-player action game with a focus on underwater exploration. Set in a sprawling oceanic labyrinth, players navigate interconnected environments reminiscent of Metroidvania design. Progression is tied to acquiring new abilities such as enhanced swimming speed, projectile attacks, or specialized diving gear that unlocks deeper zones.

Controls emphasize efficiency, requiring players to learn shortcuts and anticipate patterns. As stages advance, more onions and destinations appear simultaneously, increasing complexity.24. Caramel	is a single-player vertical shoot-'em-up game. Players pilot a craft ascending through enemy-filled skies, firing continuously while dodging projectile patterns. Power-ups enhance weapon spread, speed, or defense, but enemies increase in both volume and aggression as stages progress. Boss encounters punctuate levels with unique attack patterns that require memorization and precision dodging. Scoring systems reward chaining enemy defeats and minimizing damage taken.25. Party House	is a strategy and management game. Players manage a social venue where guests arrive with varying needs and personalities. The objective is to balance activities, resources, and space to maximize satisfaction. Mechanics include assigning guests to games, replenishing supplies, and resolving conflicts before they escalate. The experience is lighthearted but requires resource prioritization and multitasking under pressure. Difficulty increases as guest numbers grow and demands overlap.26. Hot Foot	is a single-player and multiplayer sports action game. Two teams face off in dodgeball-inspired matches where players throw, catch, and dodge projectiles. Court layouts vary, introducing barriers, hazards, or bounce mechanics that alter tactics. Timing is crucial: catching restores possession while missed opportunities leave players vulnerable. Matches are fast-paced, with momentum swinging quickly as teams eliminate opponents.27. Divers	is a single-player role-playing game with exploration elements. Set in a vast underwater labyrinth, the game emphasizes slow-paced progression and atmospheric discovery. Players command a team of divers equipped with limited oxygen and tools, forcing careful planning for each excursion.

Progression is tied to gathering resources, upgrading gear, and unlocking deeper sections of the labyrinth.28. Rail Heist	is a single-player stealth and action platform game. Players infiltrate moving trains to steal cargo while avoiding guards and obstacles. Each stage is built around stealth mechanics, with players using shadows, disguises, or timing to slip past patrols. Combat is possible but risky, making silent movement the preferred option. Objectives vary between stealing valuables, detaching train cars, or escaping at the right moment. Difficulty escalates with faster-moving trains and denser guard patrols.29. Vainger	is a single-player action Metroidvania game with gravity-based mechanics. Levels are interconnected but progression depends on the ability to flip gravity. Players can invert orientation at will, walking on ceilings to bypass obstacles, solve puzzles, and evade enemies. Combat is light, relying on positioning rather than direct strength, with hazards serving as the primary challenge. Exploration gradually unlocks new routes, rewarding creative use of gravity shifts.30. Rock On! Island	is a single-player strategy and tower defense game. Players defend a prehistoric island settlement from waves of hostile creatures by placing defensive units and environmental traps. Towers include stone throwers, spearmen, and flame-based devices, each suited for particular enemy types. Resource collection and placement timing determine survival, as stronger enemies emerge with each wave. Levels escalate in difficulty, requiring upgrades and more efficient defenses.31. Pingolf	is a single-player sports puzzle game with pinball mechanics. Each stage tasks players with guiding a golf ball to a hole positioned within elaborate pinball-style boards. Flippers, bumpers, ramps, and targets replace traditional fairways, forcing players to time shots carefully and use environmental features to their advantage. Obstacles such as traps or moving hazards require precision and planning, while bonus scoring comes from hitting certain bumpers or clearing optional routes. Levels vary from short, direct puzzles to large multi-screen arenas, blending golf rules with the unpredictable physics of pinball tables.32. Mortol II	is a single-player puzzle platform game and sequel to Mortol. Players once again progress through dangerous side-scrolling stages filled with enemies and traps. Unlike its predecessor, Mortol II introduces a “corpse mechanic” where fallen bodies remain on the stage, altering terrain and occasionally becoming platforms or hazards. This feature allows players to use past failures creatively, building makeshift routes or blocking dangers. Standard platforming challenges are supplemented with enemy waves and puzzles that require manipulating corpses strategically.33. Fist Hell	is a single-player beat-'em-up action game. Set in a world overrun by undead and demonic enemies, the game emphasizes hand-to-hand combat with limited weapons. Players progress through side-scrolling stages filled with aggressive foes, using punches, grapples, and combos to survive.

Saga uses a system called the Mind Place, a mental construct where she organizes clues, connects evidence, and builds case files that drive the investigation forward. Alan navigates the Dark Place by rewriting elements of reality with his writing, changing environments or unlocking new pathways. Both systems combine puzzle-solving with narrative progression, reinforcing the theme of perception shaping the world.

Levels are structured as semi-linear hubs with both critical paths and optional side areas.Progression is tied to bolts, the series’ currency, which are used to purchase new weapons at vendors. Gold bolts and other collectibles unlock cheats, cosmetic changes, and upgrades. Armor pieces scattered throughout the game provide statistical benefits when assembled into sets, offering resistances to certain enemy attacks or elemental effects. Weapons gain levels through consistent use. Puzzle sequences occur when controlling Clank, requiring players to manipulate multiple duplicates of himself across obstacle courses by adjusting environmental modifiers. There are also Glitch sequences where a small spider-like robot fights viruses inside corrupted systems. These interludes provide variety while granting rewards for completion.Platform-specific differences exist between releases, with the console versions using advanced haptic feedback and instant-loading transitions for rift mechanics, while the PC version includes expanded graphics settings and support for additional hardware. Both versions maintain the same narrative and core mechanics."

When a vast megastructure emerges, it becomes the focal point of exploration, philosophical debate, and hidden dangers. The player is tasked with venturing inside, solving puzzles, and uncovering the truth behind its creation while shaping the future of their people.Gameplay is centered around environmental puzzle-solving. Each puzzle chamber requires manipulation of objects and energy systems to unlock doors, activate devices, or create pathways. Tools include connectors for directing beams of light, jammers for disabling force fields, and other specialized devices that expand as the game progresses. Each area combines logic-based challenges with spatial navigation, requiring players to observe carefully and experiment with available tools.Progression occurs by completing puzzles across distinct zones within the megastructure and the wider world. Many puzzles are optional, but solving them unlocks collectibles, new equipment, and narrative insights. The difficulty escalates gradually, introducing new mechanics and combining earlier tools in complex ways. Some challenges test timing and dexterity, while others emphasize layered logic and creative solutions. Exploration outside the puzzles allows interaction with other robots, discovery of hidden lore, and collection of optional items.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes,https://cdn.mobygames.com/65edf1ba-13b5-11ef-83ba-02420a00015e.webp,"Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is a psychological puzzle game, set within the confines of a surreal and mysterious hotel somewhere in Central Europe. The game places the player in the role of an unnamed woman invited to participate in a cryptic artistic project by an enigmatic figure named Renzo Nero. The setting, a dilapidated hotel called Letztes Jahr, becomes a sprawling, nonlinear puzzle box that players must navigate to uncover layers of narrative obscured by illusion, riddles, and ambiguity.The experience is structured around an intricate web of interlocking puzzles, ranging from logical brainteasers to elaborate real-world references such as Roman numerals, strobogrammatic numbers, and classical languages. All puzzles are integrated into the game's story, encouraging players to piece together scattered documents, environmental clues, and symbolic codes in order to progress. Information is not provided through tutorials or prompts; instead, players must explore and uncover all mechanics and narrative threads through observation and deduction. A notable feature is the protagonist’s photographic memory, which stores all acquired clues for later review, though players are encouraged to supplement this with their own note-taking.Stylistically, the game is presented in a stark black-and-white palette accented with occasional red. There are fixed camera angles, minimalist vector-style 3D visuals, and cinematic framing. The aesthetic is occasionally disrupted by sudden shifts in graphical style, evoking early PlayStation visuals or 1-bit adventure game motifs. These shifts serve to underline the game's meta-narrative, which explores themes of artistic creation, illusion, and the evolution of the video game medium.Narratively, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes adopts a fragmented structure. Players begin with no context or guidance and must reconstruct the protagonist’s identity and purpose by uncovering the hotel’s layered history. Renzo Nero, the unseen host, emerges as both architect and manipulator, blurring the line between reality and performance. The game emphasizes mental discipline over mechanical difficulty, often requiring players to synthesize disparate pieces of information spread across hours of play."

The story follows Sargon, a young warrior of the Immortals, an elite Persian guard. When Prince Ghassan is kidnapped and taken to Mount Qaf, a mythical place where time itself is unstable, Sargon sets out to rescue him. The mountain is cursed with temporal anomalies, corrupted soldiers, and legendary beasts, and Sargon must uncover the truth behind the prince’s disappearance while navigating a shifting world that bends past, present, and future together.The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective, combining exploration with fast-paced combat. Players control Sargon as he leaps across platforms, wall-runs, vaults over obstacles, and uses acrobatic maneuvers to traverse large interconnected areas. Movement is tightly tied to puzzle-solving, as many areas can only be accessed with precise use of wall jumps, air dashes, or newly acquired powers that manipulate time and space. Progression involves finding new routes through the mountain and unlocking shortcuts to previously visited locations.Combat is centered on Sargon’s dual blades, which can be used for rapid melee strikes, launchers, and aerial combos. Ranged attacks, parries, and evasive dodges add tactical layers to encounters. Defeated enemies drop Spirit, a resource used to unleash Athra powers, special abilities tied to Sargon’s connection with mythological forces. Boss battles require careful use of movement and timing, as enemies often fill the screen with powerful area attacks.Character progression is handled through amulets, which grant new abilities or modify existing ones, such as improving parries, boosting health, or adding elemental effects. The player can also enhance Sargon’s weapons and powers by gathering materials hidden in treasure chests or dropped by enemies. Exploration rewards optional upgrades, hidden side quests, and collectibles tied to the lore of Mount Qaf. Save points, known as Wak-Wak trees, serve as checkpoints where Sargon can restore health and adjust his equipment.

The story continues from the events of Doom (2016), placing the player once again in the role of the Doom Slayer. Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, and humanity is on the brink of annihilation. Guided by cryptic allies and haunted by ancient rivalries, the Slayer travels across dimensions to hunt the leaders of Hell’s invasion and cut off the demonic incursion at its source.Gameplay focuses on fast-paced combat that demands aggressive movement and resource management. The Slayer uses a wide arsenal of weapons, including the shotgun, plasma rifle, rocket launcher, and the returning super shotgun equipped with a grappling-meat hook. Each weapon features multiple upgradeable mods, offering alternate fire modes such as sticky grenades or microwave beams. Precision is rewarded, as targeting specific demon weak points can disable their strongest attacks.The combat loop revolves around controlled resource balancing. Health is replenished through brutal melee executions called glory kills, armor is restored by setting enemies on fire with the shoulder-mounted flamethrower, and ammunition is gained by using the chainsaw. These interconnected systems encourage players to remain constantly offensive, using every tool available to sustain survival. Larger demons require strategic dismantling, often demanding juggling of multiple weapons and abilities to exploit their weaknesses.Progression is tied to collectibles, weapon points, and suit upgrades. The Slayer’s Praetor suit can be enhanced with exploration perks, environmental resistance, or utility improvements. Runes provide combat modifiers such as slowing down time during mid-air aiming or extending execution range.

Pentiment,https://cdn.mobygames.com/c24234f2-ac15-11ed-ac61-02420a00012e.webp,"Pentiment is a single-player narrative adventure game. The story is set in 16th-century Bavaria during a period of social upheaval and religious change. The player assumes the role of Andreas Maler, a journeyman artist working at Kiersau Abbey, who becomes entangled in a series of murders and mysteries that span over two decades. Through his choices, Andreas navigates tensions between peasants, nobles, clergy, and scholars, gradually shaping the fate of the town of Tassing and its people. The narrative is heavily influenced by historical context, drawing on Renaissance art, literature, and politics.Gameplay focuses on dialogue-driven investigation rather than combat. Players explore hand-illustrated environments styled after period manuscripts and woodcuts, moving between the abbey, village, and countryside to speak with townsfolk and gather evidence. During investigations, the player decides how Andreas spends his limited time each day, choosing which leads to pursue and which conversations to prioritize. The information collected is then used to form accusations, though uncertainty and incomplete knowledge mean outcomes are never fully guaranteed.Character progression is defined through Andreas’s background, which is selected at the beginning of the game. Players can choose areas of study such as law, theology, medicine, or languages, as well as practical experiences like crafts or travel. These choices open or restrict dialogue options and investigative opportunities, shaping how townsfolk react and what evidence Andreas can interpret. Growth occurs primarily through narrative decisions and social interactions. The game’s systems emphasize consequence and memory. Choices made in one chapter carry forward into the next, influencing character relationships, alliances, and trust.

Combat is primarily melee-based, with weapons such as wooden planks, pipes, and knives, though firearms are available later. Ammunition and healing supplies are limited, encouraging careful management. Enemies vary in behavior and resilience, requiring different tactics to avoid or defeat.The remake uses an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective instead of fixed camera angles, affecting both exploration and combat. James can perform heavier melee combos and improved dodges, while firearms allow for more precise targeting. Inventory management is streamlined, with separate categories for weapons, healing items, and puzzle objects. Saving progress is done at typewriters placed in safe rooms, retaining the series tradition of fixed save points.Puzzle-solving remains a central system, requiring players to collect keys, decipher codes, or manipulate environmental objects to progress. Difficulty levels can be set independently for combat and puzzles, altering enemy aggression or puzzle complexity. Environmental interaction is emphasized with physics-based objects, dynamic lighting, and weather effects that obscure vision and sound. Secondary systems include multiple endings determined by player choices, health management, and how James interacts with the world.

The player forms a party of characters drawn from across the Final Fantasy franchise and plays through music stages that recount iconic battles, adventures, and journeys from the series’ history. Each song corresponds to a playable level, and the player’s timing and accuracy determine both the performance of the music and the progress of the characters on screen.Gameplay is structured around three primary note inputs: taps, holds, and directional flicks. These notes appear along different stage formats. Battle Music Stages use a four-lane interface where party members face waves of enemies, with simultaneous notes and faster sequences introduced at higher difficulties. Field Music Stages feature a single scrolling lane that mimics exploration across a landscape, requiring careful tracking of hold notes that rise and fall with the melody. Event Music Stages, returning from earlier entries, play cinematic sequences from Final Fantasy titles while players follow a line of notes across the screen.Each cleared stage rewards experience points for the chosen party of characters. Over 100 characters can be unlocked, each with unique stats, abilities, and roles in combat. Characters can attack, heal, or cast spells automatically depending on their abilities, which are activated by hitting notes correctly. The player can build teams to suit specific strategies, combining characters to boost damage, improve survival, or earn more rewards. Monsters and bosses appear during Battle Music Stages, and defeating them requires consistent accuracy to maximize damage.Progression is tied to Series Quests, which allow players to follow curated sets of songs representing different Final Fantasy titles.

CollectaCards, unlockable artwork, and other cosmetic rewards provide incentives beyond music completion."
Dwarf Fortress,https://cdn.mobygames.com/5666c904-ac16-11ed-833b-02420a000131.webp,"Dwarf Fortress is a single-player construction and management simulation game; a modern remake of the classic Slaves to Armok: God of Blood - Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress (2006) ASCII-based freeware release. The game takes place in a procedurally generated world where the player guides a group of dwarves in building and maintaining a settlement. The setting is high fantasy, with civilizations, histories, religions, and myths generated uniquely for each playthrough. The player’s role is not to control individual dwarves directly but to assign tasks, designate construction, and manage resources while the dwarves act independently according to their skills, needs, and personalities.The central mode, Fortress Mode, challenges players to establish and expand an underground stronghold. Dwarves gather wood, mine stone, forge metal, and farm crops, all while fending off threats such as hostile wildlife, goblin invasions, and subterranean horrors. Managing food, drink, and shelter is critical for survival, while growth requires assigning specialized professions, training soldiers, and balancing industry with defense. Catastrophes, whether from combat, structural collapse, flooding, or disease, are often inevitable, and part of the game’s storytelling.Each dwarf has detailed statistics, skills, and personal traits. Their happiness and mental state are influenced by their environment, relationships, and experiences. Players must monitor needs such as food, alcohol, rest, and emotional fulfillment, since unhappy dwarves may cause disruptions ranging from tantrums to full rebellion. Military management introduces squad formations, training regimens, and equipment assignments, giving the player control over the defense of the fortress while still relying on dwarves’ autonomous behavior.Progression occurs organically as resources are stockpiled and industries developed. Smelting, crafting, and trading allow the fortress to produce wealth, which attracts migrants and nobles, increasing complexity and demands. Trade caravans from other civilizations provide opportunities for exchange but also expose the fortress to political entanglements. The economy grows more intricate with workshops, guilds, and mandates imposed by rulers, requiring the player to balance ambition with survival.The simulation extends to natural processes, with detailed models for weather, temperature, fluid dynamics, and geology. Animals can be domesticated or hunted, plants harvested and brewed, and artifacts crafted that become part of the world’s mythology. Failure is often framed as part of the experience, as collapsing fortresses leave ruins that can be revisited in future playthroughs.The 2022 release introduced significant graphical updates, replacing ASCII characters with detailed tilesets and sprite-based representations of dwarves, creatures, and environments. The interface was redesigned for accessibility with mouse support and clearer menus, while the underlying simulation and mechanics remain faithful to the original version."

Along the way, she encounters new allies, rival clans, and increasingly powerful machines.Gameplay builds on the systems of Horizon: Zero Dawn, combining exploration, combat, and crafting. The player navigates varied environments including forests, deserts, mountains, and underwater areas. Aloy uses a focus device to scan surroundings, revealing enemy weaknesses and environmental points of interest. Combat relies on ranged weapons such as bows, slings, and spike throwers, as well as close-range melee strikes with a spear. Enemy machines feature destructible components, which can be targeted to disable weapons, harvest resources, or expose vulnerabilities.Progression is tied to a skill tree divided into multiple playstyles, such as hunting, melee combat, machine overrides, or stealth. Players earn experience points by completing quests, defeating machines, and exploring, which unlock new abilities. Equipment can be upgraded at workbenches using materials gathered from machines and the environment. Traps, potions, and ammunition types provide additional tactical options during encounters.Secondary systems include settlements where Aloy can trade, take side quests, or participate in activities such as hunting challenges.

Set in 1937 between the films Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, the story follows archaeologist Indiana Jones as he uncovers a conspiracy centered on the concept of the Great Circle, a mysterious pattern connecting sacred sites across the world. When Nazis and rival archaeologists pursue artifacts tied to this enigma, Indy becomes entangled in a race against time, traveling from the halls of the Vatican to remote Himalayan mountains in search of answers. The player assumes his role directly, using exploration, investigation, and combat to unravel the mystery while confronting enemies who seek to exploit the discovery.Gameplay is presented primarily from a first-person perspective, blending traversal, puzzle-solving, and combat. Players navigate archaeological sites, tombs, and urban locations using climbing, rope swinging, stealth, and environmental interaction to advance. Indy’s iconic whip functions as a versatile tool: it can be used to swing across gaps, disarm opponents, or solve environmental puzzles that block progress. Traditional hand-to-hand combat and firearm use are also featured, allowing players to engage enemies through melee attacks, improvised weapons, and gunfights.Progression is structured around a series of interconnected missions, each offering different challenges such as stealth infiltration, action-driven encounters, or multi-step environmental puzzles. The whip and other tools gain importance as the player learns to combine them with the environment, for example triggering mechanisms, uncovering hidden passageways, or creating distractions. Puzzles draw on observation and experimentation, with solutions tied to symbols, artifacts, or architectural features.Combat encounters emphasize improvisation, with players encouraged to use the environment as a weapon. Objects in the surroundings can be picked up and thrown, enemies can be knocked into hazards, and fistfights replicate the rough physicality associated with the film character. Gunplay is more limited, providing ranged options when stealth or melee is not viable.The game includes cinematic set-pieces where scripted events and quick reactions move the story forward, such as chases, collapses, or confrontations with larger foes. These sequences are integrated into gameplay rather than presented as separate cutscenes, maintaining immersion while advancing the narrative. Exploration outside the main objectives often reveals collectible documents or hidden relics that expand the lore of the Great Circle."

The story continues in the same universe as Citizen Sleeper, where the player takes the role of a Sleeper, an artificial body carrying a copied human mind. This Sleeper has escaped corporate ownership and now finds themself piloting a stolen ship in the Starward Belt, a lawless expanse at the edge of inhabited space. Together with a small crew gathered along the way, the player must survive on the margins, forge alliances, and search for meaning in a sector where factions, stations, and outlaws struggle for resources and control.Gameplay centers on the tabletop-inspired dice cycle system carried over from the first game. Each cycle, the player rolls a pool of dice representing available actions and assigns them to tasks across stations, ships, and encounters. Higher values increase chances of success in dangerous work, while lower values may still be useful for routine labor or dialogue-driven challenges. This structure governs how the Sleeper explores locations, completes contracts, and pushes forward story threads, balancing risk against survival needs.Progression is tied to managing both the Sleeper’s decaying synthetic body and the upkeep of their ship. Players must secure stabilizer doses to prevent breakdown while also maintaining the vessel’s systems through repairs and upgrades. Ship modules can be expanded to add workstations, living quarters, or specialized equipment that open new opportunities during voyages. Running a ship also means managing fuel, supplies, and crew well-being, as neglecting any element can undermine long-term survival.Crew recruitment and relationships are central to advancement. Each companion comes with skills, backstory, and personal quests that intersect with the larger political and social struggles of the Belt. Crew members influence which contracts are available and how events unfold, while also bringing new abilities to the dice system. Their loyalty and morale can shift depending on the player’s choices, creating branching paths for missions and endings.Dialogue remains a core feature, with branching narrative choices tied closely to character relationships and faction outcomes. Unlike traditional morality systems, outcomes reflect pragmatic survival in a hostile world rather than binary good or evil paths. Story arcs are designed to be modular, allowing the player to pursue threads in different orders, with each playthrough producing a different sequence of alliances and consequences."

The player controls this unlikely band of heroes as they travel between planets, rescue Sparks, and stop Cursa’s forces from spreading destruction across multiple worlds.Gameplay is structured around tactical, turn-based battles that combine elements of strategy and free movement. Unlike the previous grid-based system, characters now move within circular zones that allow them to dash into enemies, reposition for cover, or team-jump with an ally to reach new areas. Combat mixes direct weapon fire, character abilities, and Spark powers that add elemental effects such as fire, shock, or frost. Enemies vary in type and behavior, requiring different approaches and positioning to defeat.Progression comes from completing battles, solving planetary challenges, and recruiting Sparks. Each hero has a distinct set of weapons and abilities that can be upgraded, while Sparks can be equipped to further customize playstyles. Players earn experience, coins, and skill prisms that can be invested into ability trees, enhancing mobility, attack strength, or defensive options.Outside of battles, the player explores open planetary environments.

Progression through the game requires winning card battles while uncovering hidden secrets in the cabin. The player takes on the role of an unnamed challenger, gradually piecing together the nature of the card game, the cabin itself, and the larger mystery tied to the world outside.Core gameplay centers on tactical card battles across a 3x4 grid. Players summon creatures using various resources: blood, bones, or energy, each gained through different mechanics such as sacrificing existing cards or having creatures perish in battle. Victory is determined by dealing damage on the opponent’s side of the scale, with damage values represented visually on a balance. Loss occurs when the opponent tips the scale in their favor. Different card types and unique sigils introduce abilities like flight, instant kills, or additional summons, creating synergies and strategic planning opportunities.Between battles, exploration allows interaction with objects in the cabin and participation in roguelike map progression. Each run places the player along a branching path where encounters include combat, campfires to strengthen cards, traders for new cards, or events that alter the deck. Defeat typically results in restarting, though the deck and options can change with every attempt. Deckbuilding is incremental, encouraging experimentation with combinations of creatures and abilities.Beyond card battles, the game includes escape-room style puzzles inside the cabin. Solving locked boxes, safes, and other hidden mechanisms grants new cards or items that affect gameplay. These puzzles also expand the narrative, hinting at the nature of the cabin’s master and the layered reality surrounding the card game.Over time, Inscryption shifts into new formats that change both the card game rules and the narrative perspective. Additional chapters introduce different card systems, including digital card interfaces, expanded resource management, and meta-narrative elements that reshape the meaning of earlier gameplay."

As doubts about the truth of the Allmother’s legacy begin to surface, the protagonist explores shifting timelines and realities to uncover hidden truths about identity, history, and survival.Gameplay alternates between third-person exploration and first-person memory sequences. The player navigates hubs and environments within the enclosed society, interacting with characters and uncovering details of the clone hierarchy. During memory dives, the perspective shifts to controlled narrative vignettes where the player relives past events through the eyes of others, experiencing both scripted sequences and sections where limited player agency influences perspective and pacing. The player transitions between futuristic facilities, memory spaces, and surreal environments, each presenting changes in visual and narrative framing.Progression relies on advancing through chapters tied to memories and encounters. Puzzles are light and narrative-driven, often requiring the player to observe, connect details, or follow prompts to continue through story segments. The game’s structure emphasizes atmosphere and storytelling over traditional combat or survival mechanics, with no resource management or direct action systems.Dialogue and choice play a role in how the player interprets events. While the overall story follows a fixed arc, branching conversations and different responses affect character interactions and the player’s understanding of the world. These decisions influence tone rather than branching into divergent gameplay paths, keeping the focus on narrative delivery."

It is set on the planet Atropos where the ASTRA Corporation explorer Selene Vassos crash lands her space ship Helios, disobeying orders as she chases after a signal she dubs White Shadow. The hostile planet has a dense environment as she looks for a way back. After dying once Selene discovers she is resurrected right away and is stuck in a time loop, waking up near the ship and having to start over all again.The game is played from a behind view as Selene traverses the environments and fights extraterrestrial entities. It consists of six biomes, each with a distinct biotechnological theme, environment and enemies. Death is permanent and an intended part of the gameplay, as the knowledge from runs is used to push deeper into the alien world. There are also several story fragments at certain points, through animated cut-scenes or interactive sequences played from a first-person view with elements of horror and mystery. Each run takes place in a unique take on the biome with reshuffled rooms, randomized enemies and items. There are also several metroidvania elements as Selene gradually gets access to new abilities, one of the few game elements that are carried over between runs.Exploring a biome eventually leads to a boss encounter where multi-tier fights borrow heavily from bullet hell games, a developer trademark, as Selene has to dodge a large number of projectiles. She has swift movement that incorporates running, jumping, dashing with a brief window of invincibility, a powerful melee attack and a single ranged weapon. There are several weapons in the game, but only one can be carried at a time. They include a pistol, a blaster and a shotgun, but also exotic types such as the Hollowseeker, an Electropylon Launcher, a Rotgland Lobber, a Pyroshell Caster, a Thermogenic Launcher and more, each with unique projectile types, an alternative fire mode with cooldown and an active reload system that punishes fumbling. A biome consists of connected rooms that feature arena-like combat against diverse and often deadly enemies in a large numbers, exploration with platforms, ledges and tunnels, and a small amount of puzzle-solving, especially for secrets and special items.There is a currency based around obolites, left behind by destroyed enemies, to fabricate consumable items and augmentations that are lost when Selene dies. This involves a lot of risk and reward as there are also parasites with both positive and negative elements, health items that are often maligned causing negative effects, and vaults (chests) that follow the same principle. Through weapon proficiency better weapons are found and enemies are level matched against them. Even the same weapons are often unique through different statistics, and traits that are unlocked gradually and then become permanent in the item pool, adding effects such as critical hits, stagger or additional attacks. Ammo is always unlimited. Risk and reward also plays a role in traversal, as many rooms and certain encounters are optional, but provide powerful rewards when the risk is taken. The player often has to choose how much time to invest in a run as well, opting to stock up on augmentations, second chances and powerful consumables, or going through biomes quickly to reach a boss fast, but often underpowered.While almost all progress is lost when dead, gradually a few optional shortcuts open up. The few elements that are carried over between runs are unlocked items that become part of the randomised pool, quicker access to certain biomes, weapon traits, certain abilities, and ether as a permanent currency. Ether is used to unlock items, avenge the ghosts of other players in powerful enemy encounters and participate in daily challenges. There is also a cooperative online mode (added post launch) that is accessed from inside a biome. Tower of Sisyphus is an endless mode set in a separate location introducing new enemies, weapons, items and story fragments."
Kirby and the Forgotten Land,https://cdn.mobygames.com/513486d2-abef-11ed-a12e-02420a000130.webp,"Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a single-player and cooperative 3D platform game. The story begins when Kirby is swept away from Dream Land into a mysterious, abandoned world where the structures of a lost civilization have been overtaken by nature. Soon after arriving, Kirby discovers that Waddle Dees are being captured by the Beast Pack, a group of animal-like enemies that dominate this strange place. With the help of a new companion named Elfilin, Kirby sets out to rescue the Waddle Dees and uncover the secrets of the forgotten land.Gameplay takes place across fully 3D stages, each containing platforming challenges, combat encounters, and hidden objectives. Kirby retains his signature ability to inhale enemies and copy their powers, allowing him to wield familiar abilities such as Sword, Fire, and Hammer, along with new ones like Drill and Ranger. Each copy ability can be upgraded between missions to unlock stronger attacks and altered move sets.In addition to copy abilities, Kirby can use “Mouthful Mode”, which allows him to inhale large objects that cannot be swallowed. This temporarily transforms him into unusual forms, such as a car, vending machine, or glider, each granting unique movement or combat options. These transformations are integrated into both traversal and puzzle-solving, offering variety across the stages.Progression is tied to rescuing Waddle Dees hidden in each level. Collected Waddle Dees return to Waddle Dee Town, which gradually expands with shops, side activities, and useful facilities. The number of Waddle Dees freed also determines access to later areas and boss encounters, linking exploration to advancement.The game supports drop-in cooperative play, allowing a second player to control Bandana Waddle Dee. In co-op, Kirby retains all copy and transformation powers while the partner uses a spear-based moveset. Coordination between players can make combat and exploration more efficient, though levels are balanced to remain fully playable solo.Secondary systems include collectible figures that can be found in stages or purchased with coins at capsule machines. These provide lore and information about characters, enemies, and items from the game. Mini-games such as fishing, serving food at the Waddle Dee Café, and timed delivery challenges add diversions within Waddle Dee Town. A Colosseum arena allows players to fight through waves of enemies and bosses for rewards, offering an additional test of skill outside the main adventure."
Cocoon,https://cdn.mobygames.com/7a6ac27e-948b-11ef-b1fb-02420a00013f.webp,"Cocoon is a single-player puzzle game. The game begins with the player controlling a small insect-like creature emerging in a barren desert. With no spoken dialogue or text, the setting and objectives are conveyed entirely through visuals and environmental cues. The protagonist journeys across alien landscapes filled with mysterious technology, shifting ecosystems, and monumental structures. The central goal is to uncover the secrets of interconnected worlds contained within glowing orbs, each harboring its own rules and environments.Gameplay focuses on exploration and puzzle-solving. The player carries orbs that function as both tools and entire self-contained worlds. Placing an orb in specific devices opens pathways or triggers mechanisms, while entering the orb transports the player into its miniature world. This creates layers of puzzles that span across dimensions, where manipulating one orb may alter the state of another. Progression requires learning the unique logic of each orb, combining them, and moving fluidly between worlds to solve increasingly complex challenges.Each orb introduces its own properties. One may grant access to hidden bridges, another could reveal light-sensitive platforms, while another alters gravity or mobility. These mechanics build upon one another, forcing the player to think spatially and track cause-and-effect across several interconnected puzzles. Combat is minimal but present in the form of large biomechanical guardians. These encounters play out as environmental boss puzzles, where survival depends on using the available tools and arena features rather than traditional fighting."

The story follows Alba, a young woman whose world is threatened by corruption spreading across the land. After surviving a devastating attack, she forms a bond with a wolf cub born in the chaos. As the two travel together through forests, ruins, and desolate valleys, Alba and the wolf must learn to rely on each other in order to endure. The narrative unfolds without spoken dialogue, instead using animation, atmosphere, and symbolism to convey Alba’s journey of survival, grief, and companionship.Gameplay combines exploration with light combat and puzzle-solving. Players guide Alba through side-scrolling environments, climbing, running, and navigating obstacles while also engaging corrupted creatures that block the way. Combat is melee-based, with Alba wielding a sword that can be chained into simple combos or used defensively against hostile enemies. The wolf serves as both a partner and a mechanic in traversal, capable of interacting with the environment to activate platforms or reach inaccessible areas.Progression is structured through Alba’s evolving bond with the wolf. As the companion grows, it develops new abilities that expand traversal and puzzle-solving options, such as pushing objects, creating pathways, or distracting enemies during combat encounters. These abilities are introduced gradually, requiring the player to adapt and use teamwork to advance. Enemy encounters are not focused on complex systems but instead on managing timing and using the environment strategically. Mistakes or defeats are handled with quick resets, keeping the experience fluid and minimizing mechanical barriers to storytelling."
Huntdown,https://cdn.mobygames.com/5b6e1202-ac04-11ed-bbce-02420a000133.webp,"Huntdown is a single-player and cooperative 2D run-and-gun shooter. Set in a dystopian future where organized crime controls the streets, players take on the role of bounty hunters contracted to dismantle violent gangs that rule the city. Each gang dominates its own territory, and missions task the player with eliminating their bosses while dealing with heavily armed thugs, machines, and criminal infrastructure along the way.Missions are structured as side-scrolling stages that combine fast-paced shooting with cover mechanics. Players can run, crouch, slide, and take cover behind objects to avoid enemy fire. Weapons are varied and include pistols, machine guns, shotguns, grenades, and more exotic firearms. Ammunition is limited, encouraging players to swap weapons frequently by picking them up from defeated enemies or scattered caches.The central challenge of each mission is a boss encounter at the end of the stage. These encounters feature distinct attack patterns and require players to learn behaviors and weak points while managing waves of backup enemies. Levels are designed to be short but intense, focusing on tight arenas filled with destructible cover and hazards. Scoring is based on completion time, enemies defeated, and collection of loot dropped by gang members, rewarding efficient play.Progression is linear, with new stages unlocked after each boss is defeated. At the start, players can select from three bounty hunters: Anna Conda, a former commando armed with an SMG; John Sawyer, a veteran carrying a pump-action shotgun; and Mow Man, a masked vigilante equipped with throwing axes. Their differing primary weapons subtly influence how combat unfolds, offering replay value across the campaign.Two-player local co-op allows friends drop-in and tackle missions together, sharing pickups and coordinating attacks. Stages also encourage replay by tracking scores, completion times, and collectible briefcases hidden in each level. There are no branching storylines or morality choices, and progression remains consistent between solo and co-op sessions."
Final Fantasy VI,https://cdn.mobygames.com/1f8db08e-b73e-11ef-8076-02420a00011b.webp,"Final Fantasy VI (also released as Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster) is a single-player role-playing game. It takes place in a world where the remnants of ancient magic clash with the power of technology. The story follows Terra Branford, a young woman born with mysterious powers linked to the long-lost art of magic. After escaping the control of an oppressive empire, Terra joins a growing resistance movement known as the Returners. As the empire’s ambitions threaten to unbalance the world, the narrative expands to include a large ensemble cast of allies, each with their own backstories, motivations, and personal quests that intertwine across the fate of a decaying civilization.The game’s structure alternates between linear story-driven segments and open-world exploration. Players navigate towns, dungeons, and world maps while recruiting new characters and managing an evolving party. The adventure unfolds through cinematic sequences, branching character arcs, and major shifts in setting and tone, including a world-altering event midway through the game that reshapes both narrative direction and exploration.Combat uses the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, where time continuously flows and each character’s turn becomes available after their action gauge fills. Every party member has a unique command ability that defines their combat role. For example, Locke can steal items from enemies, Sabin executes martial arts techniques through directional inputs, Edgar deploys mechanical tools, and Celes casts magic through a defensive Runic command. Players must manage health, magic points, and tactical turn order to balance offense and defense during encounters.Progression centers on character development through equipment, levels, and the use of Espers, magical entities that teach spells and enhance statistics. Equipping an Esper grants access to new magic as characters gain experience, allowing for individualized skill builds. Espers can also be summoned temporarily in battle to unleash powerful elemental attacks. Items, weapons, and relics modify abilities and attributes, enabling custom strategies for different party compositions.Outside of battle, the player can interact with a wide range of optional content and mini-games. Notable examples include the coliseum, where items are wagered for combat rewards, and the iconic opera sequence, which blends gameplay with narrative performance. Exploration is encouraged through hidden side quests and recruitable optional characters, some of whom contribute to alternate endings or unique story scenes.This version updates the original with redrawn 2D visuals, an orchestrated soundtrack, and revised typography. Quality-of-life enhancements include an autosave function, encounter rate adjustments, and improved menus for managing Espers, inventory, and abilities.

The story is set in the Warhammer universe and centers on the struggle for control of Ursun, the Bear God of Kislev, whose imprisonment creates a power vacuum between mortal factions and the four Chaos Gods. Players can lead nations such as Kislev, Grand Cathay, or one of the Daemonic legions, each pursuing their own objectives in a conflict that spans both the mortal world and the Realms of Chaos.The campaign map plays out in a turn-based format where the player manages settlements, builds infrastructure, raises armies, and negotiates with rival factions. Armies move across provinces to expand territory and confront enemies, with each region providing resources, strategic chokepoints, or diplomatic leverage. Victory conditions vary between factions, with some requiring dominance over rival nations and others demanding progress through the Chaos Realms to secure Ursun’s fate.When armies clash, the game shifts into real-time battles. Players command large formations of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and monsters, maneuvering them across varied terrain to outflank opponents and exploit weaknesses. Unit abilities reflect their lore origins, from Cathay’s harmony-based synergy to the Chaos factions’ daemonic powers. Hero characters and lords provide leadership bonuses and magical spells that can alter the outcome of engagements, while morale and fatigue systems influence the effectiveness of troops in prolonged combat.Progression is tied to both empire-building and character development. Generals and heroes gain experience and can be customized through skill trees that unlock new powers or improve army efficiency. Factions maintain unique mechanics: Kislev balances the competing influences of its religious and political leaders, Grand Cathay relies on trade and the harmony between Yin and Yang, and the Daemon factions embody the themes of their patron gods, each with distinct campaign rules and battle tactics. These asymmetrical designs create different strategic challenges depending on the chosen faction.Secondary systems expand the scope of play. Diplomacy allows alliances, trade agreements, and treaties, but AI rivals may be influenced by cultural aversion or alignment to Chaos. Random events, dilemmas, and scripted story missions add narrative variety across campaigns. Multiplayer includes competitive battles as well as cooperative campaigns where players can pursue parallel or conflicting goals. Mod support is available on PC versions, adding further customization for players.The game is designed to integrate with its predecessors in the trilogy, Total War: Warhammer and Total War: Warhammer II. Owners of earlier titles can access their factions in the combined “Immortal Empires” campaign, a grand-scale map that merges all three games into one extended experience."

The package includes the remastered Road to Gehenna expansion and adds an entirely new chapter, In the Beginning, which explores the early origins of the Simulation through the perspective of its original human architects. Additionally, it introduces a developer commentary mode, a full puzzle editor for community creations, and a suite of quality-of-life and accessibility improvements.The story is set in a far-future world where humanity has vanished and robots carry the legacy of human culture. Players take the role of a newly awakened artificial being exploring a vast landscape filled with ancient ruins, advanced technology, and philosophical questions about consciousness and free will. Guided and challenged by mysterious voices and texts scattered throughout the world, the protagonist must uncover the truth behind the society of machines, its origins, and its uncertain future.Gameplay revolves around solving environmental puzzles across interconnected regions. Each puzzle chamber presents mechanical devices such as jammers, connectors, and other tools that interact with gates, energy fields, and turrets. Players must experiment with spatial reasoning and timing to create solutions that allow access to sigils or keys required for progression. The structure is open-ended, with multiple puzzle hubs available at once, letting players choose which challenges to attempt in any order.Puzzles frequently combine multiple systems, requiring the player to manipulate light beams, redirect energy, and activate pressure plates while avoiding hazards. Some challenges rely on sequencing actions correctly, while others demand the creation of elaborate multi-step solutions using limited tools. As in earlier entries, exploration and experimentation are emphasized, and players can often find more than one valid approach to a problem.Progression is tied to collecting sigils and other items from puzzle chambers. These unlock new areas and mechanics, gradually raising the complexity of challenges. Certain puzzles also introduce optional golden sigils, stars, and hidden collectibles for players seeking more difficult tasks. The game includes larger-scale “mega puzzles” that integrate mechanics across multiple chambers, rewarding persistence and long-term problem solving.Outside of puzzles, players navigate expansive hub environments that encourage exploration. These spaces contain terminals with texts, interactive structures, and philosophical dialogues that develop the game’s narrative. Conversations with other AI characters introduce moral and existential debates, and choices made in these interactions affect how the story unfolds and which ending paths are available."

The protagonist, known as White, awakens without clear memory of his past but must participate in these contests, with the promise of permanent residence in Heaven granted to the victor. Along the way, White encounters other Neons who seem to share a connection with him, and interactions gradually reveal pieces of his forgotten history.Gameplay is structured around short, time-based levels where the goal is to eliminate all demons and reach the exit as quickly as possible. Players navigate stages in first person, using fluid movement abilities such as jumping, double-jumping, and dashing. Speed is the primary focus, with each stage designed for rapid completion, encouraging repeated attempts to discover shortcuts and optimize routes.Weapons are acquired through Soul Cards, which serve as both firearms and movement tools. Each card corresponds to a weapon type, such as pistols, rifles, or shotguns, but also has a discard ability that provides a mobility skill like a dash, stomp, or bomb jump. Since cards vanish when discarded, players must balance offensive use with traversal needs. Level design frequently requires combining attacks and movement abilities, forcing quick decision-making to maintain momentum.Completion times are ranked, with bronze, silver, gold, and ace medals awarded based on speed. Faster ranks unlock leaderboards and developer “insight” times, which highlight efficient strategies. Replayability is emphasized, as levels are designed with multiple possible paths that reward experimentation.Outside of stages, the player can interact with other Neons through dialogue sequences. These segments expand on story details and allow White to build relationships with supporting characters by giving them gifts collected during missions.

His survival depends on maintaining a constant feed of adrenaline through violent combat: every sixty seconds, he must kill an enemy to reset a countdown timer or risk instant death.Combat is fast-paced and heavily focused on chaining kills. MadJack wields a variety of weapons such as pistols, shotguns, and energy arms, each with distinct firing patterns and reload speeds. Defeated enemies drop weapons and temporary power-ups, encouraging players to keep moving and swap armaments often. In addition to firearms, melee strikes and finishing moves allow for close-quarters takedowns, creating a blend of ranged and hand-to-hand combat that keeps the timer replenished.The game is structured around procedurally generated floors of the tower. Each level presents compact arenas filled with enemies, traps, and environmental hazards. Players must clear rooms quickly while navigating vertical layouts and branching paths. As in many roguelikes, death is permanent, sending the player back to the start, but experience and familiarity with layouts contribute to faster progress over repeated runs.Progression is tied to upgrades earned between stages. Completing floors rewards currency that can be invested into permanent enhancements, including health boosts, weapon modifiers, and special abilities. Temporary upgrades, called buffs, can also be collected during runs, granting short-lived advantages such as explosive rounds or improved movement speed. These systems encourage experimentation with different builds and playstyles while maintaining the high-risk, high-speed loop.Visual design takes inspiration from late-20th-century anime and arcade shooters, with bold outlines, exaggerated effects, and a saturated color palette.

Unlike its predecessor, the focus is not only on day-to-day survival but also on long-term planning, with oil extraction and refinement becoming the foundation of the city’s future. As leader, players must allocate resources, plan districts, and expand infrastructure while contending with the ever-present threat of hunger, disease, and freezing temperatures.Survival depends on difficult moral and political choices. Systems of governance allow players to enact new laws that shape the city’s direction, from labor policies and social support to security measures and industrial priorities. Each decision can stabilize or destabilize the community, and political factions form based on ideology, pushing for survival at any cost or demanding humane treatment even in dire conditions. Players must balance competing visions for the future to prevent civil unrest or outright collapse.The game introduces a Council system, where factions debate policies and can shift power dynamics depending on the player’s actions. These assemblies determine the success or failure of laws, and alliances or betrayals within the Council can change the course of the city’s development. The system transforms governance into a strategic layer where diplomacy, persuasion, or authoritarian enforcement are viable paths.Secondary features include branching narrative arcs tied to ideology, with multiple endings depending on how the player handles disputes over resources, survival strategies, and morality. Exploration of the frozen world remains, with expeditions venturing outside the city walls to locate survivors, gather scarce resources, or expand influence. Unlike the first game, the emphasis is on long-term ideological survival rather than short-term crises, and choices accumulate into larger societal consequences."

The narrative branches depending on whether the player chooses Claude or Rena as the main protagonist, each perspective shaping relationships and character interactions.The adventure unfolds through exploration of towns, dungeons, and a world map, where the party recruits companions and uncovers the unfolding plot. Character interactions influence “private actions,” optional story events that alter relationships and affect which of the multiple endings are unlocked.Combat takes place in real time on a battlefield where up to four party members engage enemies. The player directly controls one character, issuing commands and chaining skills, while AI guides allies. Abilities are mapped to buttons for quick access, and each character specializes in unique weapon types and techniques. Skills and symbology (the game’s magic system) provide offensive and defensive options, while tactical positioning remains important to avoid enemy strikes and exploit weaknesses.Progression is tied to leveling up through combat and earning Skill Points, which can be invested into categories such as combat techniques, symbology, crafting, or passive bonuses. Developing skills opens up new abilities, improves statistics, and enables item creation. This system allows for a wide range of customization. Equipment upgrades through weapons and armor are also possible.Dialogue and private actions play a key role in shaping party dynamics.

The character creation menu in all games is now based on the one from ME3, and many of the designs of characters, objects and locations were backported from that game to the other two as well. All three games received a balancing pass, most notably the Mako from ME1, as well as interface tweaks, the availability of all difficulty levels from the start, and an optional new leveling system in ME1. Finally, many bug fixes are implemented, some of which fix issues with importing decisions from one game to another via savegame files.The games are accessed from a unified launcher by default, but can be started individually. The three games are otherwise separate, and can be installed separately from each other on consoles, but only the whole compilation can be installed on Windows."

Gran Turismo 7,https://cdn.mobygames.com/d660ef8a-ac12-11ed-bdca-02420a000133.webp,"Gran Turismo 7 is a single-player and multiplayer racing simulation game. The game places the player in the role of a driver and car collector who progresses through a wide range of events, licenses, and championships while building a personal garage of vehicles. Its structure mixes career-style progression with open-ended driving options, presenting both a narrative of advancement and a broad toolset for motorsport experimentation.The central mode is the GT Café, which organizes the player’s journey through themed ""menu books"" that set objectives such as collecting certain models or winning specific championships. Completing these unlocks new cars, tracks, and progression milestones. Beyond the Café, the World Map hub offers direct access to dealerships, tuning shops, license tests, and circuits. This structure reflects the traditional Gran Turismo series career format, combining guided progression with freedom of choice.Races simulate real-world motorsport rules. Vehicles vary from compact hatchbacks to high-performance race cars, each accurately modeled in terms of handling, weight, aerodynamics, and engine characteristics. Weather and time-of-day systems affect track conditions dynamically, requiring adjustments in strategy and driving style. Players compete against AI opponents or human drivers, with race outcomes influenced by both driving skill and car performance.Progression is tied to car acquisition and customization. Cars can be purchased from Brand Central, used dealerships, or earned as rewards, then tuned with parts that adjust power, handling, and efficiency. Vehicles can also be painted and visually modified with a livery editor. The player’s collection grows into a garage that can be revisited for performance upgrades or aesthetic changes, making car management a major component of the experience.Secondary systems expand beyond racing. License tests teach advanced driving techniques through scenario-based challenges, while missions provide unique race formats such as drag events or endurance runs. Music Rally adds arcade-style races set to timed songs. Online multiplayer includes both casual lobbies and structured Sport Mode races with matchmaking based on performance and driver conduct. Daily races and tournaments are also featured, encouraging long-term competitive play.The game emphasizes presentation and education as well as competition. The GT Café’s commentary provides historical context on car design and manufacturers, and Scapes mode allows players to stage detailed photo shoots of their vehicles across real-world backgrounds.Cross-platform play is supported between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions, and progress can transfer between systems. The PS5 edition adds features such as advanced haptic feedback and faster loading, though the core structure remains identical across platforms."

This entry continues the large freedom in approach to control Agent 47 in his assassination missions. New elements introduced in this entry are security keypads, time limitations, and 47's camera/scanner. Shortcuts are a new element where for instance lowered ladders become persistent across attempts. There are no multiplayer modes: Sniper Assassin is single player and Ghost Mode is removed. The PS4 version has support for virtual reality, a first for the series.The missions bring the protagonist to six new locations: Berlin (Germany), Chongqing (China), Dubai, Dartmoor (UK), Mendoza (Argentina) and an epilogue set in the Carpathian Mountains (Romania).

Doom: The Dark Ages,https://cdn.mobygames.com/297e406e-327b-11f0-a9e5-02420a0001e7.webp,"Doom: The Dark Ages is a first-person shooter and be the eighth mainline entry in the Doom franchise. It serves as a prequel to the events of Doom (2016). The game marks a stylistic and mechanical shift for the series, blending the franchise's hallmark combat with medieval-inspired aesthetics and grounded, tactical gameplay.Unlike its immediate predecessors, Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal, which emphasized fast-paced, acrobatic movement and an aggressive flow of combat driven by double jumps, dashes, and environmental mobility, Doom: The Dark Ages adopts a slower, more deliberate approach. Combat in this title is centered around the concept of the Doom Slayer as an ""iron tank,"" relying on heavy weaponry, shield-based mechanics, and enhanced melee capabilities. The game introduces a new core mechanic in the form of the Shield Saw, which allows for parrying, blocking, and offensive attacks with a single input. This shield also plays a role in both traversal and puzzle-solving, interacting with heated enemy armor and environmental objects in explosive ways. The Doom Slayer's arsenal includes new weapons such as the Skull Crusher, a gun that fires bone fragments, and a variety of melee options including a flail, gauntlet, and iron mace.The game places a renewed emphasis on narrative and world-building, expanding on the origins of the Doom Slayer and the lore of Argent D’Nur. Set during an ancient war between the Night Sentinels and the forces of Hell, the story features new characters including Kreed Maykr, Thira, and the antagonist Prince Ahzrak. Cutscenes and character-driven plot points are more prominent than in prior entries, offering a deeper exploration of motivations and internal conflict, particularly surrounding the Slayer’s struggle with external control through a device known as the Tether.Gameplay also features large, open-ended battlefields in contrast to the more confined arenas of previous titles. Enemies often spawn in formation or waves, encouraging strategic prioritization and varied approaches to combat. While the pace is more grounded, the intensity remains high. Tactical decision-making is reinforced through mechanics that reward precise timing and environmental awareness, such as executing parries to trigger area-of-effect reactions or managing cooldowns for melee attacks. There are also vehicle segments, including the piloting of a cybernetic dragon and a 30-story Atlan mech.Melee combat plays a more prominent role than in earlier installments, with three distinct melee weapons each possessing unique abilities and upgrade paths. Despite the heavier tone and slower pacing, the game retains Doom’s identity through its fluid weapon-switching system, lack of reloading, and emphasis on rhythmic, visceral combat. Classic elements such as keycard-based level progression and secret areas return.Level design features expansive environments including corrupted churches, haunted forests, shipyards, and Hellish wastelands. These areas combine Doom’s legacy of labyrinthine exploration with broader, almost battlefield-like layouts. Environmental interaction plays a larger role than before, with the shield used to manipulate terrain and mechanisms."

Since the game is an otome, players take on the role of Kisa Tachibana, a female who is forced to hide her identity in the all-men’s school. Tachibana hopes to re-kindle her passion for the theater by attending the opera school. Most of the game’s focus is on Tachibana’s participation in the final and most important show of the year, all the while trying to keep her identity a secret.Jack Jeanne focuses on Tachibana’s efforts to achieve what is called a “Quartz”, which is basically the top-ranking spot in every theater class. The game’s title derives upon the characters’ stage names; men who play a male role are referred to as Jack, while men who play a female role are referred to as Jeanne.The gameplay revolves around on two parts: the simulation aspects, in which you strengthen your bond with your classmates as the protagonist Tachibana and follows her story into the game; and the rhythm aspects, which are just the shows that the students perform while dancing in full 3D."

The story follows Peppino Spaghetti, a nervous but determined pizza chef who learns that a massive tower threatens to destroy his pizzeria. To protect his livelihood, Peppino ventures into the tower, battling strange enemies and bizarre bosses across themed floors. His objective is to survive the tower’s hazards, defeat its guardians, and ultimately save his restaurant from destruction.Gameplay emphasizes speed, momentum, and aggressive movement. Levels are built with interconnected rooms and vertical structures, allowing players to dash, wall-run, slide, and shoulder-charge through enemies and obstacles. Unlike more deliberate platformers, progress relies on chaining movements together smoothly to maintain velocity and clear areas efficiently. The design rewards both exploration and quick reflexes, as players can either scour stages for secrets or focus on reaching the goal quickly.Each stage introduces enemies that can be defeated with Peppino’s melee attacks, grabs, and throws. Defeating enemies often clears paths or contributes to score multipliers, and combat is tightly integrated into traversal, with enemies positioned to challenge or enhance the player’s momentum. Certain hazards and mini-bosses interrupt the flow, requiring players to learn attack patterns while balancing platforming movement.Progression is tied to collecting points and treasures scattered throughout stages. At the midpoint of every level, the player must destroy a pillar to trigger an escape sequence. This reversal forces players to retrace their path under a strict time limit, with failure resulting in losing the level’s progress. The escape mechanic ensures every stage has a dual structure: exploration in the first half and frantic speedrunning in the second.Points are awarded for defeating enemies, chaining combos, and finding hidden collectibles such as toppings and secrets. Higher ranks require mastering the game’s momentum system and completing escape sequences efficiently. Rank ranges from simple clear grades to the highest “P-rank,” earned only by clearing the stage without breaking the action flow."

Combat introduces a new health recovery mechanic that allows players to regain lost health from special attacks by chaining follow-up combos, as well as Star Moves, powerful super attacks fueled by collectible stars.Weapons such as pipes, knives, and bottles return, along with a new weapon catch feature that lets players throw and retrieve weapons mid-combat. Co-op play supports up to four players locally or two players online, with synergy-based combos and shared pickups encouraging teamwork.The campaign features five difficulty levels and additional modes such as Arcade Mode (single-life run), Boss Rush, and Battle Mode (PVP).

As he searches for answers, he uncovers a larger web of corporate secrecy and supernatural phenomena. The game blends noir elements, science fiction, and pulp thriller tropes.Gameplay focuses on puzzle-solving tied closely to the narrative flow. Players navigate scenes, interact with characters, and collect and combine objects to solve puzzles. The game is described as thriller with a fast pace with few quiet moments between escalating events., so inventory is often reset between chapters to keep puzzles contained within local scenes and prevent clutter. Most tasks also offer limited item options, although there are also some multi-step and chapter-spanning puzzles. Pixel hunting is avoided through environmental cues like lighting guide exploration, and a hotspot-revealing function.The game can be played with a mouse or a twin-stick controller setup. The latter uses a radial selection wheel to highlight interactable objects. Dialogue is fully voice-acted, and much of the narrative is delivered through Mick's frequent monologues. His internal commentary is a constant presence and shifts in tone depending on the context—ranging from intense or dramatic to sardonic or humorous.

Players manage a team of these characters across grid-based battlefields, confronting various enemy types and boss encounters.Combat progression introduces new tactical layers at a steady pace, including status effects, special abilities triggered by ""Voltage"" (a resource generated through combat actions), and ""Last Resort"" moves—powerful attacks available under critical conditions, often with significant risk attached.

Players must power and expand their base by attaching modules and infrastructure, much in the style of games like Fallout Shelter or X-COM.The game introduces a “Tree of Life” system that lets players view the different paths their character's life might have taken and create Alters from those timelines. Each Alter brings their own expertise and perspectives to the base’s operations, adding depth to problem-solving and interpersonal relationships. Players must manage the physical and psychological well-being of their crew, addressing their needs and disputes to avoid rebellion and conflict.Exploration plays a key role in the gameplay, with players needing to venture outside their base to gather resources, discover points of interest, and respond to environmental hazards.

It has the original creator Ron Gilbert back at the helm and picks up directly after the events of that game. However, it also incorporates and acknowledges the characters and events from later titles such as The Curse of Monkey Island (1997), Escape from Monkey Island (2000) and Tales of Monkey Island (2009).This game focuses on the series' protagonist Guybrush Threepwood as he sets out to finally reveal the secret of the Monkey Island. A short prelude explains the ending of the previous game, why this title is told as a flashback and an optional scrapbook available in the main menu is provided with a brief history of the events of all games. The adventure is divided in several parts and starts on Mêlée Island where Guybrush, reprised by Dominic Amato, once again finds himself without a ship and crew to travel to Monkey Island. Mêlée island has also changed, with Carla the swordmaster as the new governor, Elaine advocating social and health issues, and a new pirate leadership refusing to fund Guybrush's venture. Many characters from all titles return in this game, such as Stan the salesman, Otis, Wally the map maker, the Voodoo Lady and Murray the talking skull, but also many new characters. Next to the familiar Monkey Island and Mêlée Island there are entirely new locations such as Brr Muda and Terror Island.A classic point-and-click interface is used to experience the story, talk to characters and solve puzzles. When hovering over a character or object, usually one or two options are provided: to examine and to interact. Items can be picked up and are stored in an inventory where they can be combined or used in the environment. There is also a todo list as an inventory item where quests are tracked. A separate action is available to highlight all hotspots in the environment. The game can be played in an easy Casual mode or the Hard more with more puzzles. There is also a separate Writer's Cut option with more text and dialogue, available for both modes. Hints are provided through another in-game item, a hint book provided by the Voodoo Lady. The environment is also littered with optional trivia cards stored in a trivia book. Players need to answer a question about the series. If it is answered incorrectly the card disappears.The game retains its humorous approach, often breaking the fourth wall. The game uses an entirely new visual style headed by Rex Crowle and similar to the one used in his game Knights and Bikes (2019). It aims to resemble a picture book or a pop-up book with exaggerated character features, using 2D and no longer the pixel art of the original two games or the sharp cartoon or 3D look from later titles. The original composers also return with new music."

Diablo IV,https://cdn.mobygames.com/ae1bb9cc-871e-11ef-bb39-02420a000117.webp,"Diablo IV is a single-player and multiplayer action role-playing game.The story takes place in Sanctuary, a world plagued by demons, cultists, and corrupted humans. After centuries of fragile peace, the return of Lilith, daughter of Mephisto, threatens to plunge the world into chaos once again. The player takes the role of a wandering adventurer who becomes entangled in the struggle between the forces of Heaven and Hell, traveling across the regions of Sanctuary while pursuing Lilith’s followers and uncovering dark secrets. The overarching goal is to combat demonic corruption while seeking to restore a measure of stability to the land.The narrative unfolds through cinematic cutscenes and dialogue with key characters, revealing the consequences of ancient conflicts and the manipulation of mortals by higher powers. Along the way, the player can choose different approaches in conversations and decide which quests to pursue, but the central focus remains on confronting Lilith and her growing influence.Gameplay centers on real-time combat viewed from an isometric perspective. Players select one of several character classes such as Barbarian, Sorcerer, Rogue, Druid, or Necromancer, each offering distinct abilities, weapons, and playstyles. Combat involves chaining attacks, using cooldown-based skills, and combining class-specific mechanics such as elemental magic or shapeshifting. Enemies appear in large groups, including elite and boss-level foes that require positioning, resource management, and timely use of abilities.Progression is tied to experience points earned from defeating enemies and completing quests. Leveling up grants points that can be assigned to an expansive skill tree, allowing specialization in offensive or defensive powers. Equipment such as weapons, armor, and magical items can be looted, crafted, or traded, with rarity tiers that influence power and special attributes. The inventory system allows players to manage limited space while prioritizing gear improvements, socketing gems, and using consumables like healing potions.The world of Sanctuary is presented as an interconnected open map with multiple regions that can be explored seamlessly. Dungeons are randomly generated in layout and enemy placement, offering replayability. Mounts provide faster travel across large areas, while waypoints allow quick navigation between key locations. Events such as world bosses, strongholds, and random encounters provide optional challenges that reward valuable items and resources.Multiplayer integration enables cooperative play, trading, and participation in large-scale world events. Player versus player zones are designated areas where combat against other adventurers is possible, with rewards tied to risk. Seasonal events introduce new mechanics, quests, and cosmetic rewards for limited durations, encouraging repeated playthroughs. While the main storyline is designed for solo play, the game requires an online connection and supports shared world features. This structure means that dungeons can be tackled alone or with others, and large world events often require multiple players to succeed. Seasonal characters, once created, exist only for that season’s duration before transferring to the main roster, maintaining a cycle of new challenges and progression systems."

NORCO,https://cdn.mobygames.com/8728de5e-ac13-11ed-833b-02420a000131.webp,"NORCO is a single-player point-and-click adventure game. The story is set in a near-future version of Louisiana where decaying industry, corporate expansion, and environmental collapse have reshaped the region. The player takes the role of Kay, a young woman returning to her hometown of Norco after her mother’s death. Her brother Blake has disappeared, and as Kay investigates his absence, she becomes entangled in a conspiracy involving oil refineries, private security forces, and religious sects. The narrative blends Southern Gothic atmosphere with dystopian science fiction, framing the journey as both a family drama and an exploration of a changing landscape.Gameplay follows the traditions of classic point-and-click adventures. Players explore hand-painted environments, clicking to move between screens and interact with objects or characters. Conversations advance the story and often present choices that reveal background details or influence character relationships. The interface includes an inventory system where collected items are examined, combined, or used to solve puzzles that block progression.Progression is largely narrative-driven. Instead of complex inventory chains, puzzles often involve logic or dialogue-based challenges, requiring the player to pay attention to details revealed in the environment and text. Some sequences include light mini-game mechanics, such as combat presented through quick input challenges or memory-based interactions, but the focus remains on storytelling rather than mechanical difficulty.A unique feature is the “Mindmap” system, which serves as a visual notebook of characters, events, and key concepts. As the player advances, Kay’s thoughts and memories appear here, letting the player review important information or examine new connections. This system supplements the narrative by clarifying relationships and motivations, helping the player track the game’s layered plot.Branching dialogue choices allow for subtle variations in how events unfold. While the overall story has a fixed structure, individual conversations may change how characters respond or what information is revealed. Exploration is rewarded with optional interactions that expand the world’s lore, from overheard conversations to hidden environmental details."
Silent Hill f,https://cdn.mobygames.com/15e12a94-964e-11f0-8473-02420a000107.webp,"Silent Hill f is a survival horror game released as a mainline entry in the long-running Silent Hill series. It departs from the franchise's traditional American setting and relocates its narrative to 1960s Japan. The game presents an entirely self-contained story centered on a new protagonist and original location, while retaining the series' focus on psychological horror, oppressive atmosphere, and disturbing creature design.Set in the rural village of Ebisugaoka, the story follows Hinako Shimizu, a high school student whose troubled family life and personal traumas manifest in terrifying ways as her home town becomes engulfed in fog and overrun with grotesque monstrosities. The narrative blends folklore, psychological distress, and themes of social repression, child abuse, and alienation. As in prior entries, reality frequently fractures into nightmarish ""otherworlds"", where environments and encounters serve as metaphors for the protagonist’s inner turmoil. Players uncover Hinako's past and motivations through exploration, puzzles, and journal entries, with the story offering five endings that gradually expand on the truth behind the events in Ebisugaoka.Gameplay follows the survival horror tradition of limited resources and puzzle-solving but introduces several departures from earlier Silent Hill titles. Combat is strictly melee-based, with Hinako wielding improvised and breakable weapons such as pipes and bats, as firearms are absent. A stamina system governs attacks and dodges, while a sanity meter adds an additional layer of vulnerability. Exploration alternates between the decaying streets of Ebisugaoka and a surreal shrine-like otherworld overseen by a fox-masked figure, where Hinako temporarily gains supernatural powers and indestructible weapons. Puzzles draw heavily on Japanese cultural motifs and folklore."
Sword of the Sea,https://cdn.mobygames.com/6de8e0f2-7c0d-11f0-afd1-02420a0001af.webp,"Sword of the Sea is an atmospheric surfing exploration game. You play as the Wraith, reborn in a desolate world of endless dunes, gliding across waves of sand on the ancient Hoversword. Part surfboard, part skateboard, part snowboard, the Hoversword lets you carve, soar, and trick your way through vast landscapes while restoring life to a long-buried ocean.The game blends fluid movement with gentle exploration and environmental puzzles. The game emphasizes flow—missed jumps or sloppy tricks rarely break momentum, keeping the ride meditative. While there is a main path to follow, there are many optional challenges with hidden treasure chests, a tetra currency to collect, hidden shells and tiles, trick high score attack challenges and other secrets. Optional shrines can be visit to learn more about the game's world and history.Often, when restoring water to the world, new means of exploration become available. The game is entirely HUDless and when dying the main character immediately respawns. The tetra currency can be exchanged at some locations for additional abilities. Other abilities become available by progressing through the game. Environments range from glittering deserts and icy peaks to drowned ruins filled with marine life."

The story is set in Radlandia, a colorful world where skateboarding is not only a pastime but a spiritual path. The protagonist is a customizable skater who embarks on a journey to discover the mystical Skate Gods and achieve Gnarvana, a higher state of skateboarding enlightenment. Guided by a cast of eccentric companions, the player travels through themed regions, meeting challenges set by the gods while uncovering the culture and legends of Radlandia.Gameplay is presented as a side-scrolling platformer with trick-based skating. Levels are built with multiple routes, rails, and obstacles, encouraging both speed and creativity. Players chain tricks together by flicking the analog stick to perform flips, grabs, and grinds, then land precisely to maintain momentum. Flow and rhythm are central: successful sequences keep the skater moving smoothly while poorly timed inputs can break combos or result in a fall.Progression through the campaign requires completing stages in sequence, but levels often include secondary objectives and optional paths that reward skillful play. Scoring is based on trick variety, combo length, and timing, with leaderboards encouraging replayability. Certain challenges unlock cosmetic rewards, new routes, or access to more difficult stages. Levels escalate in complexity, gradually introducing hazards such as moving platforms and environmental changes that test reaction speed and mastery of controls.The game includes an extensive customization system. Players design their skater’s appearance with unlockable outfits, boards, and cosmetic items, reflecting both personal style and progress. While customization does not alter gameplay, it provides a sense of individuality in both solo play and online score comparisons.Daily challenges and asynchronous multiplayer leaderboards allow players to compete for high scores globally. A level generator called the Gnarvana Portal creates random skate runs based on selected preferences."

The story follows Amicia de Rune and her younger brother Hugo as they struggle to survive in southern France after the events of A Plague Tale: Innocence. Hugo’s mysterious illness, connected to the plague of rats spreading across the countryside, grows increasingly unstable, driving the siblings to search for a cure while pursued by mercenaries, soldiers, and the Inquisition. The narrative emphasizes their bond, with Amicia bearing the responsibility of protecting Hugo while adapting to a world that forces her into more violent choices.The gameplay combines stealth, environmental puzzles, and resource management. Amicia retains her sling as her primary tool, useful for striking targets, distracting enemies, or breaking objects. As the game progresses, she gains access to a crossbow that provides more direct ways of dealing with armored opponents. She can also craft alchemical ammunition that can ignite fires, extinguish light sources, or manipulate rat swarms. Stealth remains the preferred approach, encouraging players to use cover, control patrol patterns, and create diversions to avoid open confrontation.The rat swarms are central to the gameplay and serve as both a danger and a weapon. They move dynamically across the environment and respond to light and sound, requiring players to manipulate torches, braziers, and alchemical tools to carve safe paths. Swarms can also be turned against enemies by removing their light sources or breaking their defenses. Hugo develops abilities that allow him to sense and influence the rats, giving players temporary control of swarms or heightened perception of threats.Progression unfolds across linear chapters that introduce new challenges and mechanics. Resources are scarce, forcing players to gather materials for crafting ammunition, tools, and upgrades. Workbenches allow improvements to Amicia’s equipment, enhancing accuracy, efficiency, or carrying capacity. A skill system evolves according to the player’s actions, with frequent use of stealth, aggression, or alchemy leading to gradual growth in those styles. This approach shapes Amicia’s abilities without relying on traditional experience points."

One day, the cat is separated from his family and tumbles down deep inside the underbelly of the city. Looking for a way back, it roams the environments and meets the droids left behind, inhabiting the world devoid of the humans who designed them. The game mixes different types of gameplay in a largely linear experience. The cat navigates the environment by jumping on objects to find a way up or through sections. (Optional) prompts appear where it is possible to navigate and these can be strung together in a fluid, parkour-like chain.One type of gameplay is through linear corridors, slowly exploring and finding a route. Other sections are fast-paced, involving Zurks, creatures that form groups and try to jump the cat. They attach themselves to the protagonist and can be shaken loose, but only for a while when their number is low. It is possible to die in these sections, so quick navigation is required combined with puzzle-solving. Later on a Defluxor device becomes available with brief use to destroy them using UV light. A third type of section is more of a hub environment with a large amount of freedom. Locations can be explored in any direction, getting on rooftops, sneaking inside buildings through windows and solving puzzles along the way. These sections often have goals locating specific items or droids, but also a lot of optional quests through collectibles and locating memories that provide more information about what happened to the city. It is possible to talk to characters through the B-12 flying drone, which the cat meets early on and is carried on his back. The droid is able to offer hints, light up the surroundings with a torch, translate the environment and can communicate with other characters. There are also items that can be picked up and are stored in an inventory. Some sections incorporate stealth, sneaking past characters or quickly avoiding security droids.A lot of the gameplay revolves around typical cat behaviour interwoven with the game mechanics. It is possible to meow to attract the attention of enemies, push down items off objects, hide in cardboard boxes and jump on levers to activate them. The cat can also scratch doors to get the attention of those inside. Many of these interactions are also optional, such as lying down to sleep or nuzzling up legs."

The game introduces a new protagonist, Yakumo of the Raven Clan, while also featuring playable chapters with returning hero Ryu Hayabusa.Gameplay retains the series’ signature high-speed melee combat, emphasizing precision, counterattacks, and resource management. Players can wield multiple weapons, perform classic moves such as the Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop, and execute powerful Ultimate Techniques by absorbing essence from defeated foes. A new system, the Bloodraven Form, allows Yakumo to transform his weapon into alternate forms that can break guards, interrupt attacks, or unleash devastating combo. Combat depth is expanded through upgrade systems tied to Ninja Coins and Weapon EXP, along with optional side missions and high-difficulty Purgatory Gate challenges.The game features a 10-hour campaign set in a near-future Tokyo consumed by the miasma of an ancient dragon. Levels include linear missions with occasional traversal sequences, optional boss fights, and secret collectibles. Post-game content includes Master Ninja difficulty, Combat Trials, and replayable stages."

Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,https://cdn.mobygames.com/1965d9aa-cb3c-11ee-a2e6-02420a000120.webp,"Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a single-player roguelike horde survival game. The game takes place in the hostile caverns of Hoxxes IV, a planet rich in minerals but infested with deadly creatures. Players take the role of one of the dwarves from the Deep Rock Galactic mining company, sent into procedurally generated caves to gather resources, survive endless swarms, and escape with their lives. Unlike its cooperative predecessor, Deep Rock Galactic, this installment is a solitary mission, with survival depending solely on the player’s ability to endure and adapt in the depths.Each expedition begins with a chosen class of dwarf, equipped with distinct starting weapons and abilities. The player’s goal is to mine, shoot, and progress through waves of insectoid enemies while collecting minerals that fuel upgrades. Runs continue until the dwarf is overwhelmed or successfully completes the objectives for that dive. The structure blends mining with survival, making every descent a balance between risk and reward.Gameplay revolves around auto-firing combat combined with directional movement and positioning. Weapons automatically discharge at nearby enemies, but the player must manage dodging, spacing, and navigation to survive increasingly dense swarms. Each class features its own arsenal, such as shotguns, flamethrowers, or rifles, and these can be enhanced with modifiers collected during runs. Progress through the caves introduces tougher foes, environmental hazards, and a need for constant resource gathering.Progression takes the form of roguelike loops. Minerals gathered during missions are used to unlock permanent upgrades, new weapons, and additional character classes between runs. Within a single dive, temporary upgrades can be selected as the dwarf levels up, granting improvements such as faster firing rates, greater area-of-effect attacks, or defensive buffs. Inventory management is streamlined, focusing on weapon upgrades, perks, and resource accumulation rather than traditional equipment slots.The caves themselves are destructible and dynamic. Mining for minerals is a core mechanic, allowing the player to carve paths through rock while fighting off waves of glyphids and other creatures. Terrain destruction can provide temporary safe spaces or open routes to escape danger. Enemies spawn in escalating waves, often overwhelming the player with sheer numbers."

Vampire Survivors,https://cdn.mobygames.com/6b3cd954-ac11-11ed-a7ec-02420a000134.webp,"Vampire Survivors is a single-player roguelike horde survival game. The setting places the player in rural landscapes plagued by monsters, where they control a chosen character who must withstand continuous waves of supernatural enemies. Each run begins with only a simple weapon and limited mobility, but survival requires gathering resources, destroying countless foes, and holding out for as long as possible against an ever-growing horde.Gameplay centers on automatic attacks and constant movement. Weapons fire on their own once obtained, leaving the player to focus entirely on positioning, dodging, and navigating dense swarms of enemies. Surviving longer rewards experience gems dropped by defeated creatures, which grant level-ups. Each level-up presents randomized weapon or passive upgrades, encouraging adaptation to the run’s circumstances and offering the possibility to combine items into stronger evolved forms.Combat escalates with waves of bats, skeletons, werewolves, and other monsters filling the screen in increasing numbers. The objective is not to defeat all foes but to endure until the survival timer reaches its limit, typically thirty minutes, after which an unavoidable final enemy appears to end the run. Because of this design, progress comes not from winning battles but from outlasting the relentless enemy density.Progression carries across runs through a meta-upgrade system. Players earn gold to purchase permanent enhancements such as improved health, faster movement, or additional projectiles, which apply to all future characters. Numerous characters can be unlocked, each with unique starting weapons and traits. Stages also expand over time, with new maps, enemies, and environmental hazards being revealed. Collectibles known as relics introduce new mechanics like permanent arcana cards, which alter weapon behaviors or unlock special synergies. Hidden secrets and conditions open access to additional characters, stages, and powerful items."

Unpacking,https://cdn.mobygames.com/aff569fa-ac0f-11ed-927d-02420a00012f.webp,"Unpacking is a game about unpacking items and fitting them in a new location after moving. Starting in 1997, each level offers a new location and a new period in the protagonist's life as they move to a new environment with eight periods in total. It always starts with one or multiple empty rooms filled with cardboard boxes. A single bedroom at first, players eventually need to unpack for an entire house with many rooms. Selecting the cardboard box changes the cursor into an object lifted from inside. It can then be placed in the room, such as inside cabinets, on top of a shelf on a desk etc. The box disappears automatically when there are no more items inside. Most items can be put anywhere, but after everything is unpacked incorrect placements are highlighted in red. For instance: a toothbrush cannot be stored on a desk, but needs to be placed in the bathroom. There is some freedom and there is no time pressure, but only when all items are in a correct location is the environment completed. Because there are many objects that need a location, there is some puzzling involved to make everything fit.Items from boxes are not always in the correct environment, so the player needs to move them between rooms. It is possible to move between rooms at any time, as well as zooming and scrolling, for instance to get a good look at a specific object. Some items can be stacked. It is also possible to rotate objects and sometimes this is done automatically, for instance when moving a rolled up poster towards a wall so it can be hung. After a level is completed pictures (screenshots) can be taken and it is possible to decorate them as well as apply filters. The sped up version of the unpacking process can be viewed again through an animation or a GIF."
Marvel Spider-Man: Miles Morales,https://cdn.mobygames.com/1cfae498-ac16-11ed-bc39-02420a000131.webp,"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the second game in the PlayStation exclusive Marvel's Spider-Man series, following Marvel's Spider-Man (2018). It is centered around Miles Morales, a fictional comic book superhero who becomes Spider-Man as a Black teenager of Puerto Rican ancestry on his mother's side, following the death of Peter Parker. The game handles it differently compared to the original storyline in the comic books, continuing the narrative of the first game (and especially the DLC The City That Never Sleeps) where Miles Morales is bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider and gained powers similar to Peter Parker's. Miles trains under Parker and is still integrating in the role of a Spider-Man. In the game Parker does not die, but leaves to join his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson to cover a civil war, leaving Miles as the only webslinger in New York. The story focuses on the campaign of his mother Rio Morales, and the defense of his home neighborhood in Harlem and New York City against a high-tech criminal army called the Underground and Roxxon Energy Corporation who are in a gang war.The game builds on the same type of gameplay as the original game, offering a large open world that can be explored at a fast pace by running on buildings and swinging with web shots. Most of the Manhatten map is still identical to the one of the original game, as the game is more of a smaller contained follow-up than a full-blown sequel. It now has a different theme however as it is set around Christmas time. Various types of quests and missions are offered with a mix of fights against groups of characters or relying on a more stealth based approach. Many are provided through an app citizen use to contact him. Stealth receives more attention in this title as Miles has the ability to become invisible for a short time. Other new abilities include bioelectricity where electricity is absorbed to use it as a weapon, for instance launching a Venom Punch, but also as a means to solve environment based puzzles.As in the first game there are many collectibles (often providing bonuses and gadget upgrades) and side missions to earn activity tokens and experience points. Gradually more power are unlocked for Miles' new suits or for his visor. Some items also add to the story, for instance through time capsules that show portions of Miles early life and audio-focused collectibles that provide information about his family."
Battlefield 6,https://cdn.mobygames.com/ae0fedae-68a0-11f0-ab15-02420a000119.webp,"Battlefield 6 is a first-person shooter that continues the long-running Battlefield franchise with a return to large-scale, class-based multiplayer combat following the more experimental Battlefield 2042 (2021).The game reintroduces traditional Battlefield mechanics such as the four-class system, large destructible environments, and vehicle-based warfare across expansive maps supporting up to 64 players. The focus is on territory control through returning modes including Conquest, Rush, and Breakthrough, alongside smaller-scale variants such as Team Deathmatch and Domination. These are joined by Portal, a map and mode editor enabling user-generated content drawn from past Battlefield titles.Gameplay emphasizes combined-arms combat across both infantry and vehicle roles. Battles unfold dynamically, with players free to specialize as engineers, medics, assault troops, or support roles. The series' hallmark of emergent, player-driven scenarios remains central, allowing for varied tactics ranging from aerial dogfights to ground-level infantry skirmishes. Weapon handling and ballistics have been redesigned for faster, more responsive gunplay, moving closer to contemporary military shooters with refined recoil patterns, faster projectile speeds, and a Gunsmith-style weapon customization system.The launch version features nine maps, including Mirak Valley, New Sobek City, Operation Firestorm, and Iberian Offensive. Larger maps prioritize vehicle combat and open engagements, while smaller arenas focus on close-quarters firefights. Environmental destruction and real-time weather effects return, enhancing both strategy and spectacle.Progression and customization follow a familiar structure of unlockable weapons, attachments, and character cosmetics earned through play. Equipment and vehicle loadouts can be adjusted mid-match, and players earn experience for teamwork-oriented actions such as reviving allies, repairing vehicles, and capturing objectives.A single-player campaign is included, following the operations of the spec-ops unit Dagger 13 in missions set across urban and desert environments. The campaign uses scripted objectives and linear progression, focusing on squad-based infiltration and sabotage missions. Despite featuring traditional Battlefield themes of large-scale warfare, the campaign limits direct vehicle control and destructibility compared to the multiplayer component."

It is the first original Gradius-related game to be released in 17 years (the last being Gradius: ReBirth released in 2008, or 14 years if counting Otomedius Excellent from 2011). It continues the Salamander spin-off series with six stages and a mixture of classic and new gameplay elements. Players control either the Vic Viper Type L or the Lord British MK III, navigating stages filled with enemies, environmental hazards, and boss encounters. The game supports solo play or local two-player co-op.Combat focuses on familiar power-ups such as Speed Up, Missiles, Lasers, and Ripple Lasers, which can now be upgraded by collecting duplicates. A new ""Burst Mode"" temporarily powers up weapons into more destructive forms, like Hyper Ray and Buster Ripple, before cooling down. Another addition is the ""Multiple Change"" system, allowing players to customize the formation of their ""Multiples""—satellite units that mirror the player's firepower—up to a maximum of eight. It provides a mix of the classic power-up system from the Salamander series, as well as new power-ups shared from Gradius: Neo.The story follows the princess of Latis piloting her brother's restored fighter craft against a renewed threat from the Salamander Force. She is joined by the Gradius Army as they confront returning bosses and new enemies across a range of biomes, including asteroid fields, volcanic deserts, and magnetic planetoids. While narrative elements remain minimal, the game builds on the visual and mechanical legacy of the series, offering updated sprite work, modernized sound design, and remixed music tracks that reference previous entries."

Travellers Rest,https://cdn.mobygames.com/1376ebe8-ac06-11ed-96e1-02420a00012d.webp,"Travellers Rest is a single-player simulation game. The player takes the role of an innkeeper in a medieval fantasy setting, inheriting a small tavern with the goal of turning it into a thriving establishment. Guests of all sorts pass through the inn’s doors, from weary travelers to merchants and adventurers, and it is the player’s responsibility to keep them fed, rested, and satisfied. There is no overarching narrative beyond the management and growth of the tavern, with progress determined by how well the player maintains and expands their business.From the start, the tavern is bare and modest. The player must furnish it, brew drinks, cook meals, and serve patrons while keeping the atmosphere welcoming. Cleaning, stocking supplies, and ensuring smooth service are part of daily operations. As the inn becomes more successful, profits can be reinvested into renovations and expansions, adding more seating, decorative flair, and new brewing or cooking equipment.Gameplay revolves around crafting and management systems. Players gather ingredients such as grains, hops, fruit, and herbs to produce beer, wine, spirits, and meals. Recipes can be customized by adjusting proportions and ingredients, leading to variations in quality and patron preference. Brewing and cooking are time-based processes, requiring careful planning so that food and drink are ready when needed. Serving customers involves quickly providing their orders while keeping tables clean and tavern morale high.Progression is tied to experience points earned in various activities like brewing, farming, cooking, and socializing. As skills increase, new recipes, crafting stations, and farming techniques become available. Farming outside the tavern is an important element, allowing the player to cultivate crops, raise animals, and secure a steady supply of raw materials. Balancing farming tasks with tavern service creates a cycle of preparation and execution that drives the game forward.The economic system plays a central role. Profits from running the inn can be used to buy seeds, ingredients, and furniture. Customers pay based on the quality of food, drinks, and overall atmosphere. Prices can be adjusted, but overcharging may discourage guests. Inventory management is key, as running out of supplies during service reduces customer satisfaction and income. Strategic investments in brewing casks, ovens, or decorative items gradually elevate the inn’s reputation."

Hrot,https://cdn.mobygames.com/1f5ef4e8-ac09-11ed-9f52-02420a000130.webp,"Hrot is a single-player first-person retro shooter that borrows heavily from the original Quake, using a visual style that resembles 1990s software-style rendering with unfiltered textures and polygon jitter, combined with a color palette that consists mainly of grey and brown. Optionally the game can be played in a GL mode with hardware acceleration. It is set in Czechoslovakia after an unspecified disaster in 1986. It consists of three episodes with about eight levels each, along with a secret level. Episodes were made available over time as the game was launched in Early Access on 29th January 2021 and it was then in development for about two and half years until the full release on 16th May 2023. The first episode was available right away, the second one was added on 22nd June 2022 and the third one with the full release.The player's character emerges from a civil defense shelter deep under a Prague Metro station, having survived the disaster. Wearing a gas mask, all intruders in the country now need to be eliminated. Locations have a dark and grim setting, but there are also many quirky and humorous elements often based on soviet culture. Many of them have real, historical details and inspirations. Humans have been affected by the disaster. They wear gas masks and can often be spotted throwing up. There are also mutated creatures. The weapon arsenal consists of pistols with dual-wielding, two types of shotguns, grenades, a machine gun, a rocket launcher-like Hussite hand cannon, a crossbow, a sickle for melee combat, but also experimental weapons such as a lightning gun. A bottle of alcohol is used as a medkit and distorts the character's vision. Along the way small health pick-ups can be found as well, along with power-ups such as additional damage and a Koruna currency. The character has access to a flashlight at any moment. Enemies are heavily inspired by those in Quake, but with a soviet twist. Bosses often take on unexpected forms and there are mechanical opponents such as sentry guns, loaders and helicopters.Levels have a linear design using typical progress based on keys that need to be located to unlock doors, switches and valves. The environments are filled with socialist paraphernalia and a lot of interaction is encouraged. Most items are destructible and next to the sickle a kick is available as a melee attack. That is often required to find the secrets hidden in the levels. Many interactions are optional such as flushing toilets, destroying light bulbs, answering a phone, playing a game of football, playing a synthesizer, riding a motorcycle, playing games on a handheld or standing on a billiards table to move the balls.Encountered enemies are stored in a bestiary that can be consulted from the main menu, along with recipes that are unlocked after completing an episode. After completing a first episode an Endless mode is unlocked with wave-based arena combat based on four environments. Completed levels can be selected from a level select screen. There are five difficulty levels. When playing the campaign mode, a blank slate mode can be enabled where health and weapons are not carried over between levels."
Death's Door,https://cdn.mobygames.com/b44420d8-ac0e-11ed-887e-02420a00012e.webp,"Death's Door is an action RPG about the character Crow, a bird and also a reaper of souls. It is an employee at the Reaping Commission Headquarters, a bureaucratic institution that tasks people like Crow with soul reaping while providing commissions on successful retrievals. At the start of the game it has to bring back a giant soul, but after defeating that demonic forest spirit it is attacked from behind and the soul is stolen. Crow cannot move on until the soul is secured, so there is no choice but to help the old reaper that tricked him and collect several other giant souls that may open the titular Death's Door where the soul is now held.From a central location called the Lost Cemetery, Crow can access different areas leading to the three giant souls it needs to defeat and bring back to Death's Door. The character can be moved around freely and has two melee attacks along with a ranged attack with limited ammo. Eventually five different weapons can be unlocked and they can be changed on the fly. They vary in style, appearance and statistics such as damage, swings, range and swing time. The regular melee attack is for quick hits, while the second one can be charged or a strong attack or is executed following a dodge roll. Ammo for the ranged attack can be found through items or by hitting enemies. Melee, but especially ranged attacks are often used to solve puzzles such as hitting items or setting them on fire from a distance. Many areas require environment based puzzle-solving to collect items and progress. There are many enemies to defeat along with several larger boss fights that require figuring our patterns, dodging and sometimes puzzle-solving to discover weaknesses.There is a checkpoint and fast travel system through doors. At certain locations a door can be unlocked that leads back to the central Hall of Doors at the Reaping Commission Headquarters. From there Crow can quickly return to any area at any time or choose another door. When Crow dies he returns to the last unlocked door. At the HQ there are characters to talk to, puzzles to solve and the Soul Vault where four characteristics can be upgraded several times: strength, dexterity, haste and magic. Each upgrade requires soul energy collected by defeating enemies. Health can be replenished by picking up seeds and planting them in specific pots. Upon consumption all health is restored, but this can done only once at that pot until Crow dies or leaves the area to return.The game also contains many secrets and optional collectibles. Over time three additional magic items are unlocked as additional ranged weapons that can be switched on the fly similar to melee weapons. The new magic types often open up additional paths or secrets in previously explored areas metroidvania-style, or allow Crow to pursue a new path or open a new gate that was previously locked or out of reach. There are several characters to talk to and the game contains many humorous elements."
Age of Wonders 4,https://cdn.mobygames.com/2efde0be-e857-11ed-bd8a-02420a000178.webp,"Age of Wonders 4 is a 4X turn-based strategy which returns the franchise to its original fantasy setting. Despite this, it combines gameplay elements from both Age of Wonders III and Age of Wonders: Planetfall with numerous changes and additions.The most obvious change is the absence of conventional races. When starting a new game, players have to choose a template for the race (humans, elves, orcs, goblins, animalkin, etc.) and then select various faction focus types, followed by customizing the traits and visuals of the ruler unit. Upon a match's end, rulers can ascend to a pantheon, from which they can be reused with their acquired skills in future matches. This will also unlock points and new cosmetic customization options. For the first time in the series, units can also be visually customized, albeit to a lesser degree than rulers. Randomly generated worlds now have 8 slots for custom options, which handle basic features like map layout and neutral army strength to modifiers for the gameplay itself.Each player now has a limit on the number of cities they can claim, but each city can annex a considerably larger amount of regions (which are also smaller in size than in Planetfall). These regions are automatically claimed with a specialization building from the assigned city's screen. A major change is seen in the city production aspect, as unit recruitment is handled by the new auto-generated resource called Draft instead of sharing Production with city buildings. This also means that cities now have two production queues, one for buildings and the other for units. Settler units have been scrapped in standard gameplay, as cities can only be claimed from others or evolved from outposts built by hero/ruler units. Heroes no longer join the player randomly, but only when their hero limit is raised, most commonly by building/claiming a new city. Finally, city sieges have been introduced as a gameplay mechanic.Diplomacy has seen a slight improvement as well, with different and more meaningful proclamations added, some options even being brought from Planetfall covert operations. This allows for more varied communications between players. Free cities also make a return, with diplomatic options vastly expanded. Full vassalage takes more time to build up relations towards, as there are multiple relation stages, but phases in between bring their overlord economic benefits.The techtree is represented by a literal tree graphic split to several different branches, and its elements require the Imperium resource to purchase. Tomes are a more combat-oriented military research option, with each one bringing a new level of spells, upgrades and units which can be mixed to the player's liking.Side quests no longer require visiting specific sites, and can occur seemingly at random, with several options given to the player, each bringing different bonuses and/or penalties. Hostile NPC army spawners have also seen an upgrade - they take up an entire region instead of a single tile, and are initially dormant until their territory is trespassed upon. They vary in size, with larger ones being better-defended.The game is playable in single- and multiplayer (online and hot seat), with a map editor and several other tools bundled in. Cross-play multiplayer capabilities between platforms were implemented in the Watcher Update on 15 August 2023 (at launch, only players who purchased the game on Steam, GOG.com or Epic Games Store could play with each other, while Windows Apps and Xbox Series players were separated in their own cross-play segment)."

The Darkest Files,https://cdn.mobygames.com/259726b2-09a6-11f0-8138-02420a000143.webp,"The Darkest Files is a historical investigation game set in Germany in 1956, in the aftermath of the Second World War. Players take on the role of Esther Katz, a young prosecutor tasked with reopening unsolved murder cases linked to Nazi crimes. Despite the war ending over a decade earlier, many atrocities remain buried, and Esther's mission is to bring long-overdue justice to the victims.The game follows two murder investigations inspired by real historical events. Players collect evidence, interrogate witnesses and suspects, and piece together timelines to build cases that can stand up in court. Success requires carefully comparing testimonies, identifying inconsistencies, and constructing a clear sequence of events to present during trials. The narrative highlights both the personal and political challenges of confronting the remnants of Nazism in post-war Europe.Much of the game unfolds in Esther's Berlin office, where players interact with colleagues, examine documents, and prepare for legal proceedings."
